Crossing that barrier would mark a new test of the limits of the human body.\n\n\"This is what we want to find out: What happens to the human body when it breaks the speed of sound,\" Baumgartner said. \"That's a big question mark.\"\n\nTo increase his chances of survival, his parachute is set to open automatically, even if he's unconscious or spinning so fast his hands are pinned by the G-force. He said his engineers are taking every precaution, testing out the suit in a wind tunnel and providing him with a backup chute, sealed gloves and boots, and an advanced helmet.\n\n\"This helmet also has face-shield heating to make sure your visor's not getting fogged up on the way down, because that would be fatal,\" he said. \"If you don't see anything, you can't move anymore. You can't make decisions.\"\n\nStill, the risk of the unknown remains. \"If something happens, it happens fast,\" he said. \"You can never say you're not going to get killed under any circumstances,\" but \"we have a lot of solutions for emergency situations like this.\"\n\nA chain reaction of events would have to occur before the jump could turn fatal, he said.\n\nA potential benefit from the mission, he said, would be demonstrating that it is possible to return from space without a spacecraft.\n\n\"In the future, a lot more tourists will go and travel to space. And if something goes wrong with their spacecraft, they have to return to Earth somehow,\" he said. \"We will show to the world that egress from high altitude is survivable.\"\n\nThe main difference is that Baumgartner will start from a standstill, whereas astronauts in a craft like the space shuttle are traveling at orbital speeds close to 18,000 mph when their re-entry begins.\n\nThe previous record for the highest jump has stood for half a century, since it was set in 1960 by Joe Kittinger with the Air Force. He reached an altitude of 102,800 feet, and says it felt like a very distant and hostile place to be.\n\n\"You know that right outside of you is a vacuum of space,\" he said, \"and without the protection of that pressure suit, you cannot live. And that's an interesting thought.\"\n\nBaumgartner, whose attempt is being financed by energy drink maker Red Bull, has enlisted Kittinger as a consultant.\n\n\"We have learned a lot from people in the past who tried to break that record, and they all failed,\" Baumgartner said. \"Some of these people got killed.\"\n\nBut he adds, \"I think it's human nature, you know. Records are meant to be broken. And I'm a very competitive person. I like the challenge.\"", "question": "What is the name of the man who holds the current record, which is 102,800 feet?"}

But no action has been taken at this point, and the institution doesn't have a plan for incurring the cost, she added.\n\nThe privilege of showing off a shuttle won't be cheap -- about $42 million.\n\nThis figure will include $28.2 million for the removal of hazardous chemicals -- such as ammonia, used as a coolant, and nitrogen tetroxide and hydrazine, used as fuel; $5.8 million for moving the shuttle via a carrier aircraft to its new location; and $8 million for preparing the shuttle for display, Curie said.\n\nA carrier aircraft will be the only way to deliver a shuttle to a landlocked location, and such aircraft will no longer be in NASA's budget once the shuttle program ends.\n\nAfter chemicals are drained from the shuttle, its estimated weight will be about 170,000 pounds, Curie said.\n\nWhatever facility receives a shuttle must have experience in displaying space hardware and major historical artifacts, NASA said. The shuttles will be released without their engines, which, along with other components, will be offered separately. The deadline for responding to NASA is March 17.\n\nNASA emphasizes that it will pay special attention to ensuring that the shuttles will retire to \"appropriate places.\" The agency wants them to remain in the United States, and private collectors likely would not meet NASA's goal to have the orbiters and engines displayed publicly, Curie said.\n\n\"We really feel that these are artifacts that are important to the history of the country and that as many people as possible should have the opportunity to see them if they can,\" Curie said.\n\nAsked whether NASA had considered trying to sell the shuttles on eBay, he laughed: \"No, that probably wouldn't be the prudent thing to do with something paid for by taxpayers' money.\"\n\nIn January 2004, President Bush called for an eventual shift in focus from the space shuttle program to the new Vision for Space Exploration program, which NASA describes as \"a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system.\"\n\nBush has said he wants astronauts to return to the moon by 2020.

Stevens was concerned that too much time had elapsed between sentencing and the planned execution, amounting perhaps to cruel and unusual punishment.\n\n\"Johnson bears little, if any, responsibility for this delay,\" said Stevens, who said procedural hurdles at the appellate stage for capital defendants created what he called \"underlying evils of intolerable delay.\"\n\n\"The delay itself subjects death row inmates to decades of especially severe, dehumanizing conditions of confinement.\"\n\nIt is an issue that the 89-year-old justice has long urged his colleagues to address, with little success.\n\nIn his early years on the high court in the mid-1970s he had supported the resumption of the death penalty after a four-year moratorium imposed by the Supreme Court. But in recent years, he has voiced his opposition to capital punishment, particularly in cases involving inmates asserting their right to challenge their sentences.\n\nThomas reacted strongly to Stevens' statement. The conservative jurist said the inmate had challenged his conviction and sentence for nearly 29 years and \"now contends that the very proceedings he used to contest his sentence should prohibit the state from carrying it out.\"\n\n\"In Justice Stevens' view, it seems the state can never get the timing just right. The reason, he has said, is that the death penalty itself is wrong.\" Thomas said. \"As long as our system affords capital defendants the procedural safeguards this court has long endorsed, defendants who avail themselves of these procedures will face the delays Justice Stevens laments.\"\n\nThen Thomas goes on to say there are \"alternatives,\" citing the custom in England centuries ago to carry out an execution the day after a conviction.\n\n\"I have no doubt that such a system would avoid the diminishing justification problem Justice Stevens identifies, but I am equally confident it would find little support from this court.\"\n\nThe high court had been presented with Johnson's emergency appeal early Tuesday afternoon, but apparently the time needed to produce the Stevens and Thomas statements delayed the high court from issuing its denial of a stay until 1:38 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nThe execution was carried out as scheduled, with no problems reported by corrections officials.", "question": "Who was put to death by legal injection in Tennessee?"}

The issues of no male heir for Crown Prince Naruhito, the continued talk of constitutional changes for females to rule and family rifts over the role of the Imperial Household Agency were speculated to be the cause.\n\nTsugunomiya Akihito was born on December 23, 1933 in Tokyo to Emperor Hirohito and Empress Nagako Kuniat as their fifth child and first son.\n\nAccording to Japanese legend, he is a direct descendant of Japan's first emperor Jimmu, circa 660 BC. Akihito means \"shining pinnacle of virtue,\" and Tsugunomiya means \"prince of the august succession and enlightened benevolence.\"\n\nAt about the age of five, Akihito was separated from his parents, in accordance with Japanese custom at the time, and raised and educated by chamberlains and tutors.\n\nHis youth was packed with events so dramatic that they today seem unimaginable, including Japan's brutal military invasion of China, its foray into World War II and subsequent defeat followed by an unprecedented foreign occupation.\n\nAkihito's post WWII private tutor was an American Quaker, Elizabeth Gray-Vining from Philadelphia, who also happened to be the only foreign guest at his wedding. Married to Michiko Shoda in 1959, he was the first Japanese crown prince to marry a commoner (they met playing tennis), despite the fact there was a designated list of about 800 potential candidates.\n\nThe marriage produced three children; Hiro no miya Naruhito Shinno, Crown Prince Naruhito (born February 23, 1960), Akishino no miya Fumihito Shinno, Prince Akishino (born November 30, 1965), and Nori no miya Sayako Naishinno, Princess Sayako (born April 8, 1969).\n\nOn November 12, 1990, Akihito ascended to the Chrysanthemum Throne -- the oldest hereditary monarchy in the world -- as the 125th Emperor of Japan, one year and ten months after the death of Emperor Hirohito.\n\nThe position, per Japan's constitution, is defined as \"the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people.\" That said, the office's involvement in day-to-day government affairs tends to be minimal.\n\nAkihito broke from precedent following Japan's epic 9.0 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami earlier this year, when he gave a historic, televised speech on March 16.

But planes remain vulnerable for short periods of time during some flights when pilots go to the lavatory, get meals or, on long flights, change out crews.\n\nCurrently, flight attendants sometimes block the aisle with beverage carts to prevent possible terrorists from rushing the cockpit. But pilots believe the barriers -- relatively inexpensive gates that would be deployed before pilots come out of the cockpit -- would solve that vulnerability.\n\n\"This is an absolute no-brainer,\" Capt. Bob Hesselbein of the Air Line Pilots Association said. \"Of all the things we could do, the most cost-effective thing we could do right now is put the device in.\"\n\nALPA this summer published a position paper calling on the U.S. and Canadian governments to require secondary flight deck barriers on all airliners by January 1, 2010. The barriers would be designed to delay anyone trying to attack the cockpit by at least five seconds, giving pilots time to retreat to the cockpit, ALPA said.\n\nHijackers have attempted to gain access to flight decks on planes overseas four times in the past year, according to ALPA.\n\nThe airline industry has fought efforts to require the barriers, saying airlines should be allowed to decide for themselves if the barriers would improve security. The barriers would not be useful on short hauls where pilots don't ordinarily leave the cockpit, and the airline industry claims other layers of protection are sufficient on longer flights.\n\nHesselbein disagrees.\n\n\"You can never guarantee that you're going to have an armed pilot protecting that cockpit from inside that cockpit. You can never guarantee that you're going to have a federal air marshal, or federal air marshal team, in the cabin to defend that cockpit.\n\n\"But the secondary barrier, once installed, will always be there,\" Hesselbein said.\n\nThe government has classified the number of federal air marshals and armed pilots, but it is widely known that they cover a small percentage of flights in the U.S.\n\nIn a June 2005 report to Congress, the Transportation Security Administration said the barrier \"appears to be a simple solution that offers greater security at a relatively low cost.\"\n\n\"Valuable time is gained in deterring the movement of an unauthorized individual towards the flight deck,\" the report said.\n\nBut the TSA recommended against mandating secondary barriers, citing \"the costs of engineering and installation that would be incurred by the [airlines] to retrofit\" aircraft. \"The economic fragility of the industry due to increasing costs, including persistently rising fuel prices, makes this a decisive recommendation.\"\n\nThe Air Transport Association, which represents the nation's major airlines, said hardened cockpit doors and other measures provide effective security and that mandating other measures should not be done \"in the absence of appropriate risk analysis.\"\n\nRep.

The drug, developed by a German firm, was used internationally as a sedative and hailed because overdose simply caused prolonged sleep, not death.\n\nThalidomide also was combined with other drugs to create medications for asthma, hypertension, and migraine, according to the Thalidomide Trust, which supports victims.\n\nDoctors and scientists began to notice gross limb malformations in infants starting in 1960, and scientists linked it to thalidomide the next year. By then, it had affected babies from Kenya to Peru to Japan, though most of the cases were in Germany, where the drug had been available over the counter.\n\nThere are currently 466 people in the United Kingdom whose mothers took the drug when they were in the womb. Most of them have two or four limbs missing, and some also can't see or hear, according to the trust.\n\nOne of them is Louise Medus-Mansell, who was born in 1962 with no arms or legs.\n\n\"It is a bonus, something that we didn't think would ever happen,\" she told CNN about the government's apology. \"There's a lot of people today that have been waiting for this apology from the government that have had partners die.\"\n\nMedus-Mansell, who recently had a kidney transplant, published an autobiography this year titled \"No Hand to Hold and No Legs to Dance On.\"\n\nHealth Minister Mike O'Brien said the British government is creating a £20 million ($32.5 million) fund over three years to meet the health needs of Thalidomide victims, who are between 45 and 51 years old. The money will be distributed by the Thalidomide Trust, he said, and will help reduce further degeneration of their health as the victims grow older.\n\n\"The government wishes to express its sincere regret and deep sympathy for the injury and suffering endured by all those affected when expectant mothers took the drug thalidomide between 1958 and 1961,\" O'Brien said in the House of Commons.\n\n\"We acknowledge both the physical hardship and the emotional difficulties that have faced both the children affected and their families as a result of this drug, and the challenges that many continue to endure, often on a daily basis.\"\n\nThe problems caused by the drug led the British government to review the marketing, testing, and regulation of drugs, O'Brien said.

But critics, including several leading Republicans and some commentators, said the $75 billion proposal will unfairly help some people at the expense of others.\n\nWhite House spokesman Robert Gibbs acknowledged Friday that some people who made \"bad decisions\" might end up getting help under the proposal. But Donovan, Obama's secretary of housing and urban development, told CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday that \"there are no 'flippers,' investor-owners or scammers that are eligible for this program.\"\n\n\"We're going check everybody's income when they come into this program.

Mark Sanford, a Republican who also has criticized the administration's stimulus package, called the mortgage plan \"a horrible idea.\"\n\n\"About 95 percent of folks are playing by the rules and struggling, but still paying their mortgages.

To stabilize them, the foreclosure prevention program calls for doubling their lines of credit with the federal government to $200 billion each.\n\nDonovan said 45 percent of home sales in December were \"distressed,\" meaning either sellers were facing foreclosure or the homes were already seized by the bank, driving down home prices further in an already-battered market.\n\n\"We've got to make clear, here, that a foreclosure hurts every American,\" he told CNN.\n\nIn releasing his proposal Wednesday, Obama said it would help both responsible homeowners suffering from falling home prices and borrowers either at risk of or already in default.

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers.\n\nBrooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Getting into North Korea was one of the weirdest processes VBS has ever dealt with. After we went back and forth with their representatives for months, they finally said they were going to allow 16 journalists to come and cover the Arirang Mass Games in Pyongyang. Just before our departure, they suddenly said, \"No, nobody can come.\" Then they said, \"OK, OK, you can come. But only as tourists.\" But they already knew we were journalists, and over there if you get caught being a journalist when you're supposed to be a tourist you go to jail. We don't like jail. And we're willing to bet we'd hate jail in North Korea.\n\nBut we went for it. The first leg of the trip was a flight into northern China. At the airport, the North Korean consulate took our passports and all our money, then brought us to a restaurant along with our tour group. All the other diners left, and these women came out and started singing North Korean nationalist songs. We were thinking, \"Look, we were just on a plane for 20 hours. Can't we just go to bed?\" But this guy with our group who was from the L.A. Times told us, \"Everyone in here besides us is secret police. If you don't act excited then you're not going to get your visa.\" So we got drunk and sang songs with the girls. The next day we got our visas. A lot of people we had gone with didn't get theirs.\n\nWe flew into North Korea that night. We were supposed to have three days before the games started, but as soon as we got on the ground they told us, \"The games are happening now.\" We went straight to the stadium, and there were 40,000 people in the stands, portraying the history of the North Korean revolution with flip cards. On the playing field before them, about 60,000 people did wild synchronized-gymnastics routines. The 15 of us who made up the audience watched from a marble dais. We were the only spectators. Fifteen audience members for a 100,000-man extravaganza.\n\nSee the rest of the Vice Guide to North Korea\n\nThe next day, our grand tour began. We went to the International Friendship Museum, which comprises 2,000 rooms carved into the bottom of a mountain. The displays are all gifts from different world leaders. Joseph Stalin gave Kim Il-sung a train. Mao Zedong also gave Kim Il-sung a train. He got hunting rifles from communist East Germany's Erich Honecker and Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu and all the other Eastern-bloc guys. Madeleine Albright famously gave Kim Jong-il a basketball signed by Michael Jordan.\n\nPerhaps the weirdest thing about North Koreans is that they genuinely don't seem to know that the rest of the planet hates and fears them. They believe (or maybe they really convincingly lie about believing) that the whole world admires and envies them and that they're the true light of socialism and Juche, which is their leader's philosophy of Communist self-reliance.\n\nAs the days went on, North Korea presented us with progressively stranger sights and encounters.

Shakespeare died in 1616.\n\nThe Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.\n\nThe most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.\n\nThe identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.\n\nThe portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.\n\n\"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.\n\n\"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"\n\nWells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.\n\n\"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.\n\n\"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"\n\nIt should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.\n\nThe public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.\n\nThe portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "question": "Who saw a copy of the painting on display in a museum?"}

After her rescue, Dean, her mother and her brother returned to England with a canvas sack, among other possessions.\n\n\"There is speculation that this would have been the bag. It's a leather and canvas bag. You would easily get a child or infant in it,\" Aldridge said, though he added that research by the Smithsonian, the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag.\n\nGiven that the auctioneer cannot prove Dean was rescued in the bag, \"we expect it to fetch £3,000 ($4,480). If it was the bag she was rescued in, it would be £30,000 to £40,000, ($44,800 to $60,000), but we can't prove it. It depends on what people are prepared to believe.\"\n\nAldridge said he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible.\n\n\"She's in a residential nursing home. She's 97 years of age. She's paying £3,000 a month in nursing home fees,\" he said -- the amount he hopes her canvas bag will sell for.\n\n\"As she said, £3,000 a month is £36,000 a year, which is a lot of money,\" he said. \"When she runs out of money, the state will pay fees for her, but while she can pay her fees, she decides where she gets her care. When the state pays, they decide.\"\n\nDean's previous sale, in October, raised just over £30,000, Aldridge said.\n\n\"It's made a lot of people aware of her plight; a lot of people have sent her funds,\" he said.\n\nDean never married and had no children.\n\n\"There are cousins, but there is no one directly to support her,\" Aldridge said. \"The property she lived in [before she moved to the nursing home] was not hers. She's just an ordinary little old lady.\n\n\"If she's lucky, she'll get another four or five years; she's quite a fit lady,\" he said.\n\nDean was not available to speak to CNN herself because of a throat infection, Aldridge said.\n\nThe auction will include 17 items from her collection, most of them memorabilia related to the Titanic and signed by her but not from the ship itself.\n\nThe auction, in Devizes, southwest England, will also include a collection of letters from the estate of Titanic survivor Barbara Dainton-West, estimated to fetch £40,000 to £60,000 ($60,000 to $90,000).

We may express ourselves differently, but the fact we do respond and do feel that is something very basic,\" she said.\n\nAnd while there are hardships involved in being one of the world's finest violinists, it still remains a pure pleasure.\n\n\"As musicians we're trained to be self critical so we can get better. But fundamentally we love music. It's a love that drives us to practice and keep working at it. It's something I love so much and gives me so much joy.\n\n\"With that comes hardships... there's never a state of perfection. You try and you try and you try, but at the end you know you can't be perfect. It's humbling, so that it becomes a motivating force,\" she told CNN.\n\nContinuing her work outside of the concert hall, Midori was made a UN Ambassador for Peace in 2007, a role she relishes.\n\nWhile it presents her additional opportunities to talk about issues close to her heart, it's also a position that nourishes her inquisitive mind and another means to connect with people indirectly through her music.\n\nThese experiences make the world a little more vivid than it was before. And I'm grateful for that; it's also something that motivates me to continue to do it,\" she said.", "question": "who was a prodigy?"}

Those remains were moved to another grave site.\n\nIn 2003, as workers were digging a grave for a new burial, they discovered a casket already buried there. There was no headstone or grave marker to indicate who. Only recently, after a report by a journalist at Salon.com, did the Army take action on the problem. Over the summer, the cemetery put up a headstone on the mystery grave that reads \"Unknown.\"\n\nAs McHugh ordered the new investigation, the Army released results of a separate investigation of problems at the cemetery. That investigation focused on the discovery of the \"Unknown\" grave.\n\nA spokesman for the Military District of Washington, which conducted the review, said \"Cemetery records, the MDW investigation, and the non-invasive geophysical analysis of the grave sites strongly indicate that a husband and wife, who died years apart and should have been buried in the same grave site, were instead buried in adjacent graves.\"\n\nA DNA test of the remains in the two adjacent graves could prove conclusively that is what happened, but the family of the husband and wife did not wish for their remains to be disturbed. The MDW said the Army will abide by the family's wishes and has ordered a headstone to properly mark the wife's grave.\n\nOne of the problems discovered by the MDW investigation was a possible lack of adequate staffing at the cemetery. Last year Arlington conducted 4,377 burials, up more than 21 percent over the past 10 years. During that same period the number of civilian staff members has dropped nearly 19 percent.

While playing semi-professional football, he spent 10 years as a gym teacher at a school for children with learning difficulties.\n\nMost of his playing days were in the midfield of De Graafschap, a smallish club with no history of winning silverware. He later spent two years playing in America before returning to retire at De Graafschap.\n\nWatch CNN's exclusive interview with Hiddink »\n\nLittle, then, to suggest that here was a man who would achieve so much in his later career. But great players seldom become great managers.\n\nHis first steps in that direction came at De Graafschap, Holland, where he was assistant manager before moving to the same role at Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven.  See key moments from Hiddink's career »\n\nBy 1987, at the age of 40, he was in charge of PSV and led them to their 1988 European Cup win, a feat unthinkable today. He almost reached the final again in 2005 during his second spell in Eindhoven.\n\nHiddink's keeper at PSV, Hans van Breukelen, revealed some of the manager's methods. \"He's very interested in people and immediately tries to create a family environment,\" he told Britain's Sun newspaper.\n\n\"I can vividly remember him smoking and having a cup of coffee with his players. I don't know if he still smokes, but he was a chain smoker at PSV.\"\n\nHiddink's resume includes stints in other high-pressure jobs such as Fenerbahce, Valencia and Real Madrid, but it's on the international scene where his shrewd tactical mind, organizational skills and motivational prowess grabbed attention.\n\nSemifinalists with Holland at the 1998 World Cup, he took over South Korea in 2001 and led the co-hosts of the 2002 World Cup to the last four. No Asian country had ever gone as far in a World Cup before and he left the job a national hero.\n\nHe agreed to coach another underdog in the shape of Australia in 2005 and led them to the 2006 World Cup. There, the Socceroos had eventual winners Italy rattled for much of their second-round match before succumbing to a late, controversial penalty.\n\nHiddink took Russia to Euro 2008, where they were beaten by Spain at the semifinal stage.\n\nNaturally his hometown Varsseveld wanted to capitalize on Hiddink's huge global popularity. The \"Guuseum\" was built in his honor, which for a time was particularly popular with South Koreans on a pilgrimage to see from where their idol hailed.\n\nChelsea were in the doldrums when he arrived on a short-term deal in January as a favor to his comrade, Roman Abramovich, the club's billionaire owner.\n\nAnd the Hiddink magic has worked again, giving the Blues direction to a season that was drifting under previous boss Luiz Felipe Scolari.\n\nBut the straight-speaking Dutchman is loyal to the project he has in charge of the Russian national side and insists he will leave Chelsea at the end of the season regardless.\n\nSure of himself but free of ego, Hiddink knows what he wants.

Although the Herrmans did not report him missing, \"they were very worried about him,\" Eisenbise said.\n\nIn an interview published Tuesday in The Wichita Eagle, Valerie Herrman said Adam ran away in May 1999 after she spanked him with a belt. She said she was upset but doesn't remember why, The Eagle reported.\n\nThe couple never reported Adam missing, Valerie Herrman told the paper, because they feared authorities would take Adam and his siblings away because of the spanking.\n\nThe couple adopted his two younger siblings as well, according to The Eagle.\n\n\"We love him, and we made a terrible mistake\" by not reporting him missing, Doug Herrman told The Eagle.

However, though they're rare birds, there are guys who will want to spend hours dissecting even the most innocuous comment, examining it for tone, content and what you might've been implying.\n\n3.

That he takes longer than you to get ready is strike one against him, but the fact that he matches his socks to his underwear and to his ascot drives him out of the park.\n\n5. The OverEater: It's an irritating fact that men can eat more than women. The overeater doesn't care. Food is his first love and he'll push cannolis and baked ziti on you like a crazed Italian granny. Unless you don't mind a future spent in stretch-pants, you might want to give this dude a pass.\n\n6.

But one man is using the game to bring young Catholic and Protestant men together on the same team in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nAfter graduating college, Michael Evans coached basketball at two high schools in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nFormer college basketball player, Michael Evans, 26, in partnership with another basketball player, Dave Cullen, created the organization Full Court Peace to help forge friendships between between schools in the divided communities.\n\nHe spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about how Full Court Peace works. The following is an edited transcript of the interview.\n\nLapin: So you wanted to use basketball as a bridge but you started Full Court Peace almost to dupe these youngsters into working together?\n\nEvans: Yea that's one way to put it. I think what I did was I just coached basketball separately in two high schools. And, uh, on the opposite sides of these walls I've been talking about. And I got roughly five on each side to latch on to me. These 16-year-old boys. You know, they came from broken homes and I showed them loyalty. That's what coaches do, is show their players loyalty and the kids latched on to me, so much that I was able to sell the idea of making an integrated team out of their enemies and it was a complete success.  Watch more on Michael Evan's organization Â»\n\nLapin: They didn't think that they were going to work with the other side. Like Robert, for example, one of your players who is Protestant. What did he think when he was going to work with a Catholic team?\n\nEvans:That was a pretty discouraging moment throughout the whole process of forming that team. I told Robert the news and he shunned me. He couldn't believe that the time I'd spent with him alone was really just basically me trying to convince him to join this team. I thought I might have lost him.\n\nLapin:  Now he's also friends with the other side to this day. There was a little bit of hesitation at first, I know they did speak, but are they still friends?\n\nEvans:They are still friends. I recently went back to Belfast and had dinner with a lot of them all together. And the ones that couldn't meet for the integrated dinner asked about their team mates. The neighborhoods are too divided for them to visit each other so they communicate a lot online through bebo.com which is a social networking site over there. And they keep up with each other. They're not bashful about having pictures of each other, arm-in-arm on their social networking sites, and they communicate through me about each other because I'm in touch with all of them.\n\nLapin: So that's amazing, Michael. How do you think you do this? How does sports diplomacy, which is really what this is, succeed where world leaders, prime ministers and presidents have failed?\n\nEvans: I mean just because a politician, two politicians come together and say they agree on something, it doesn't mean that the people on the ground are going to be agreeing on it. And most importantly the youth that are growing up in these environments, that doesn't mean that they agree with what's going on. So that's sort of just a face to the whole solution.\n\nI think what sport does, namely basketball, is that you put kids in a small, very small group together and they're forced to communicate in order to succeed; in order to win. And then the coaches role is very unique in that the kids all bond over having one voice and one person telling them what to do and guiding them along and helping them with success.", "question": "How do the friends communicate since it's too dangerous to visit?"}

But for mobile users, those maps have always stopped just short of indoor spaces -- until now.\n\nGoogle Maps 6.0 for Android launched Tuesday with a bold initiative: indoor mapping. Partnering at launch with a selection of businesses and public service structures, the new mobile Maps version allows users to see the entire layout of a mapped building, switch between floor plans if the structure has multiple levels, and locate indoor points of interest like retail stores, bathrooms and ATMs.\n\nObviously, indoor mapping is only useful when the building you're navigating is big enough to warrant it.\n\nTo this end, Google has partnered with more than 25 major businesses that handle large crowds on a regular basis -- major travel sites like San Francisco International and Chicago's O'Hare airports, as well as giant retailers like Macy's and Bloomingdale's.\n\nConsidering the layers of thick concrete and steel holding up some of these buildings, it's been difficult for Google to get its location-aware technology up to snuff.\n\n\"GPS is unreliable and doesn't work well indoors,\" said Maps project manager Steve Lee in an interview. \"We used similar information to how we've implemented the navigation 'blue dot' feature in the past, and we've been able to improve the accuracy indoors, at an accuracy of about 5 to 10 meters.\"\n\nWhile half of the initiative begins in U.S. structures, Google is simultaneously launching in Japan, covering Tokyo's massive underground subway network and retail shopping centers (an area where new visitors definitely need a map).\n\nWhile version 6.0 isn't covering U.S. transit, Lee says the Japanese transit coverage \"can give us a sense for what's in store for the future.\"\n\nWhile it's just a beginning, Google has also launched a beta tool that allows businesses to upload their own floor plans to the Maps database.\n\nSlowly but surely, Google hopes to entice more businesses and major indoor areas of interest -- both small and large -- to opt in for indoor mapping. Of course, these are private spaces, not freely accessible public roads, so it's an initiative for the long haul.\n\nThe update is currently available in the Android Market for phones and tablets running Android version 2.1 and up.\n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

He said police threatened him with money-laundering charges and promised not to prosecute if he signed over the cash, which Daniels said was to buy a new car.\n\nDaniels and other motorists who have been stopped by Tenaha police are part of a lawsuit seeking to end what plaintiff's lawyer David Guillory calls a systematic fleecing of drivers passing through the town of about 1,000.

In about 150 cases, virtually all involving African-American or Latino motorists, the seizures were improper, he said.\n\nAll defendants in the lawsuit deny wrongdoing. In a written statement, Russell's attorneys said the prosecutor \"has used and continues to use prosecutorial discretion ... and is in compliance with Texas law, the Texas constitution and the United States Constitution.\"\n\nBut the attention paid to Tenaha has led to an effort by Texas lawmakers to tighten the state's forfeiture laws.", "question": "What year was the money confiscated?"}

Opening to only $6.6 million, the PG-rated kid flick landed in a weak 6th place finish for its opening frame.\n\nThe only other new release to reach the top ten was Fox Searchlight's post-college flick \"Post Grad\" starring Alexis Bledel. Despite opening in 1,959 locations, the film grossed only an estimated $2.8 million for the three days.\n\nAmong holdovers, \"District 9\" did incredibly well considering Basterds was angling directly for its male audience. The $30 million sci-fi movie from newcomer Neil Blomkamp dropped a scant 49% to $18.9 million putting its total ten day gross at an impressive $73 million.\n\n\"G.I. Joe\" also hung in for its third week in theaters. The high-octane actioner fell only 44 percent to $12.5 million. It's three-week cume now stands at $120 million. Female moviegoers helped keep \"The Time Traveler's Wife\" and \"Julie & Julia\" in the top five.\n\n\"Time Traveler\" dropped only 46 percent to $10 million its second week putting its ten-day gross at $37.4 million while \"Julie & Julia\" fell only 25 percent, which is remarkable considering the movie is in its third week of release. Grossing $9 million for the three days, the Meryl Streep, Amy Adams two-hander has now earned $59 million total.\n\nThanks to the strong opening of \"Basterds\" and the solid hold of the incumbent films, the box office was up 26 percent compared to the same time last year. It's the third week in a row the box office was up after four weekends of unimpressive results. Next weekend's horror mash-up of \"Halloween II\" and \"The Final Destination 3-D\" should yield some positive results too.\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly", "question": "what company had a harder time with a movie release"}

According to the university, Miller's attorney has said the records were inadvertently taken from the center when Miller left his job there more than a year before the shootings.\n\nThe records detail a phone evaluation by the counseling center on November 30, 2005, and on December 12, 2005. Cho was evaluated in person following his release from a mental health facility on December 14, 2005.\n\nHe was sent to the facility on a temporary detention order, the records indicate, after a female student filed a complaint with university police that Cho had been instant-messaging her and left a message on her dry erase board. The records from the facility, Carilion St. Albans, note that Cho told his suitemate he might as well kill himself because \"everybody just hates me.\"\n\nThe records said Cho stayed overnight at the facility. \"Essentially, it does not appear that he had any serious intent when he made the suicidal statement,\" the records said. \"He was counseled about the need to act responsibly.\"\n\nIn each of the three evaluations at the Cook Counseling Center, Cho \"explicitly denied any intent to hurt himself or others and there was no evidence to the contrary,\" Virginia Tech said in its statement. \"At the time of his last appointment, Cho was completing his fall 2005 semester exams and was scheduled to spend the holiday break with his family. He was provided with emergency contact information.\n\n\"As we know, Cho never called or returned to the Cook Counseling Center, and more than a year elapsed between the time he was evaluated by counseling center professionals and the tragic events of April 2007.\"\n\nThe records also contain a December 14, 2005, e-mail to the center from a university housing official, documenting Cho's \"history of erratic behavior and counseling-based issues at the time of his referral to Carilion St. Albans.\" Cho's suitemate had notified police because he had made suicidal statements and had \"blades\" in his room, said the e-mail.\n\nVirginia Gov. Tim Kaine said last month the files were discovered at Miller's home in connection with a civil lawsuit, but did not elaborate. The records' absence was a mystery and a concern during the investigation, he said. The governor said his office was asking the Cho family for permission to make the records public.\n\nCho's family agreed earlier Wednesday to the records' release. \"The family has consistently favored and urged disclosure of their son's and brother's records in the interest of advancing the investigation into the tragic events of April 16, 2007, as well as ensuring that the families of the victims have as much information as possible,\" said family attorney Bernard DiMuro in a letter to Mike Melis, Virginia assistant attorney general.\n\n\"The unavailability of pertinent counseling center records during more than two years of investigation and review has created needless uncertainty and understandable speculation that has compounded the suffering of the survivors, families and the Virginia Tech community as a whole,\" the university said in a statement.\n\nThe records confirm facts already established by the panel that reviewed the incident, the university said.

The Oversharer will broadcast intimate episodes from your relationship to his mother, your mother, his blog readers and anyone else he can rope into paying attention.\n\n2. The OverThinker: One of the great things about dating men is that you aren't subjected to long, excruciating interrogations over what you really meant when you reassured him that no, he didn't look fat in those pants. However, though they're rare birds, there are guys who will want to spend hours dissecting even the most innocuous comment, examining it for tone, content and what you might've been implying.\n\n3. The OverTalker: Your friends say they've never known you to be so quiet. That's because this man does enough talking for both of you (and then some). When you do finally eke out a sentence or two he interrupts and talks over you anyway. You have two choices -- accept the fact that you will never speak again or tell him goodbye. Your call.\n\n4. The OverDresser: This dandy makes Gossip Girl's Chuck Bass look sloppy and mismatched. That he takes longer than you to get ready is strike one against him, but the fact that he matches his socks to his underwear and to his ascot drives him out of the park.\n\n5. The OverEater: It's an irritating fact that men can eat more than women. The overeater doesn't care. Food is his first love and he'll push cannolis and baked ziti on you like a crazed Italian granny. Unless you don't mind a future spent in stretch-pants, you might want to give this dude a pass.\n\n6. The OverReactor: Remember when Russell Crowe threw a phone at that hotel clerk who somehow displeased him? That's this guy. From the old lady who accidentally bumped into him at the grocery store, to the SUV that cut him off on the highway -- everyone in his path will hear his wrath. You, most of all. Do not walk away -- run.\n\n7. The Over-The-Topper: He's the life of the party and thinks nothing of driving his motorcycle through the bar if he thinks it'll get a laugh. He's certainly cute, but he just never stops. He's always on. And that, will quickly turn into a turn-off.\n\n8. OverAchiever: Picture the male version of Tracy Flick in the movie \"Election\" in perfectly fitted jeans, a crisp white oxford shirt and a copy of his (perfect, naturally) SAT scores in his wallet. Now imagine making love to him. You can't, can you?\n\n9. The OverCompensator: Maybe he was the homeliest kid in his eighth-grade class, but that doesn't mean you need to sit through a monologue about how much money he makes, how jealous his friends are over his new BMW, and how he totally could date supermodels if he wanted to.

She'd just gotten news that she found impossible to comprehend: Her eldest son, Robbie, a fourth grader, had died.\n\nAbout an hour earlier, Robbie had been running the bases at Little League practice near their home in Merrick, a suburb of New York City. Levine's husband, Craig, who coached the team, was standing at first base when Robbie ran by him.\n\n\"I remember thinking I'd never seen him run so fast,\" he recalled.\n\nBut seconds later, he turned to see that his son had collapsed right on home plate. Craig Levine ran to Robbie's side, realized that Robbie didn't have a pulse and began administering CPR. Several minutes passed before an ambulance arrived. Robbie was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nWith two other young children, Jill Levine says she didn't give herself the option to become paralyzed with grief after her tragic loss. Instead, she took action.\n\n\"I knew that [Robbie] could have had a chance if there was a defibrillator,\" she says.\n\nSo for the past 2½ years, Levine has dedicated herself to raising awareness about the need for these cardiac devices in youth sports, which she does through her Robbie Levine Foundation, co-founded with her husband.\n\nAutomated external defibrillators -- also known as AEDs -- administer electrical shocks that can restore a heart to its normal rhythm. When used in conjunction with CPR, these machines can make the difference between life and death.\n\nThe American Heart Association reports that after sudden cardiac arrest, every minute without CPR and defibrillation reduces survival by 7-10 percent.\n\nMore than 165,000 adults die from sudden cardiac arrest each year, according to the heart association.

China's Ministry of Health reported eight human cases last month, including four deaths.\n\nSince 2003, the World Health Organization has confirmed 404 human cases worldwide. Nearly two-thirds of the victims have died. While H5N1 doesn't make headlines the way it did in 2005, health officials say the continuing severity of the infections means the alarm is still on.\n\nInfluenza viruses, in general, spread easily. If H5N1 were to acquire the genetic ability to pass easily from person to person, it could turn into a major catastrophe.\n\nMany countries have stockpiled both vaccines and antiviral medications, for such a scenario. The same medications that are used to treat regular flu, oseltamivir (Tamiful) and zanamivir (Relenza), also seem to be effective against H5N1. But that's no reason to rest easy.\n\nAll flu viruses tend to mutate rapidly, which is why the flu vaccine one year, won't protect you against the next year's flu. Those rapid mutations mean the virus tends to develop a resistance to any widely used medication.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, told CNN, \"It always happens that eventually, sooner or later, the [flu] virus will develop varying degrees of resistance. You just hope that it's kept to a minimum.\"\n\nThe findings in Nature may lead to another option to fight bird flu, but an actual new drug is years away. A vaccine could be effective, but they first have to know what strain of flu they're fighting.\n\nThe current strategy of health officials around the world is to try to contain isolated cases before they spread.

Look no further than your cell phone bill.\n\nClark Howard says consider switching to a less known cell provider to save money and avoid signing contracts\n\nIf you're with one of the four big providers -- AT&T, Sprint, Verizon or T-Mobile -- you're almost certainly overpaying for service. In addition, all four have a business model that's based on cowardice. They've developed lousy, stinking, rotten two-year contracts because they're afraid to compete in the marketplace.\n\nThankfully, there are a variety of smaller players in the market who offer nationwide coverage for less money with no contracts.\n\nBefore considering any adjustment to your cell phone plan, you'll need to start by assessing how much you talk, text and surf the Web on your phone. Watch Clark discuss the pros and cons of bundling services\n\nIf you use less than 300 minutes per month, you'd probably do much better with a prepaid plan where you buy minutes as you need them. Net10.com is one service I usually recommend -- no roaming charges, no long distance charges, no monthly fees and a flat 10 cents per minute for calls.\n\nIf you use more than 300 minutes per month and you travel from time to time, you might want to consider either Metro PCS or Cricket. Both have plans ranging from $25 to $50 and offer unlimited calling. The difference in price points is based on how many other features you want -- texting, Web surfing and so on. But there are never any contracts or overages.\n\nFor heavy cell phone users, there are Boost Mobile and Virgin Mobile. Both are engaged in an all-out price war that can directly benefit you.\n\nVirgin Mobile is offering $49.99 per month unlimited calling -- no roaming charges and no contract. If you want texting, you'll pay an additional $10 per month for unlimited service. If you want high-speed Internet, you'll pay another $10 per month on top of that for a 50MB plan.\n\nBoost Mobile's $50 per month plan already includes unlimited calling, texting and Web access. And that $50 even includes junk fees!\n\nOne caveat here: Remember, my definition of \"cheap\" means that I'm willing to accept lower quality for a lower price. So consider this caveat carefully and do your own research before making any final decisions about your cell provider.\n\nSpeaking of cheap, a new competitor in the marketplace may have both Boost and Virgin beat. Straight Talk offers a cellular plan for $30 per month. You get 1,000 minutes, 1,000 text messages and 30MB of data for that price.\n\nIt's important to remember that very few people use more than 1,000 minutes per month. The typical person clocks in at 790 minutes and pays an average monthly contract bill of $67, according to Nielsen Mobile studies of U.S. adults on individual cell phone contract plans.\n\nSo, what are you waiting for? Consider firing your \"Big 4\" cell provider and going with one of the smaller guys. The savings are there for the taking.\n\nFinally, CellTradeUSA.com can help you get out of your existing contract by trading it away to someone else. This tends to work particularly well if you have a hot phone that everybody wants.", "question": "What advice does Howard give?"}

He apparently is now in Somalia training and counseling Somalis from North America and Europe. He speaks in American English.\n\n\"Away from your family, away from our friends, away from ice, candy bars, all those things is because we're waiting to meet the enemy,\" says the man believed to be al-Amriki.  Watch part of the video »\n\nIntelligence experts say the video was probably made in recent weeks and comes on the heels of an audio message in March purportedly from Osama bin Laden. In that recording, the al Qaeda leader calls on his \"Muslim brothers in Mujahid Somalia\" to overthrow President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed for cooperating with the West.\n\nAl-Shabaab is the militant Islamic wing in Somalia. It means \"Youth\" in Arabic.\n\n\"We're seeing perhaps their most sophisticated attempt so far to really reach an audience of potential recruits in America, and that's one of the things that made that video very significant,\" said Ben Venzke of the IntelCenter, a Washington-based research group that tracks al Qaeda's development and messages.\n\n\"They're casting it in a way that's going to speak to the youth of today,\" Venzke said. \"Most of the time, what we're seeing in their videos directly parallels what the groups are doing operationally, what they are targeting, where they're recruiting.\"\n\nSheik Ahmed Matan knows that firsthand. A respected member of Britain's Somali community, Matan said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men who have returned to Somalia for terrorist training.\n\n\"A lot of young people from here, from America, from Canada, from everywhere from Europe -- they went there,\" he said.\n\nHe added that these men are capable of being sent back home to conduct terrorist operations, even suicide bombings.\n\n\"It can be, they can train anytime and send them here, anytime,\" Matan said.\n\nSomalis from North America and Europe are beginning to come to terms with the problem of recruitment, he said. The United States and British governments say Somalia is an emerging terror hot spot, which could pose a threat beyond its borders.\n\nMatan said he often challenges \"recruiters\" at mosques and elsewhere in Britain, demanding that they stop brainwashing younger Somalis about Islam. He said the government should play a greater role in monitoring what is said and done at these mosques -- but, he concedes, doing so has proved highly controversial in Britain and throughout Europe.\n\nThere is some evidence that al Qaeda is successfully preying on some of those with Western backgrounds. One of them was a business student from London who suddenly left for Somalia. He surfaced about 18 months ago on a martyrdom video, just before blowing himself up in southern Somalia, killing at least 20 people, officials say.\n\nU.S. Defense officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said months ago that one of their worst nightmares would be al Qaeda operating freely in Somalia. Now that nightmare continues, with Somalis in North America and Europe admitting that al Qaeda's reach is spreading.\n\nVenzke said Al-Shabaab has put out more videos than ever before in the past year.\n\n\"If that's what they're doing publicly, we can only assume how their operations have developed,\" he said.", "question": "what did the video come on the heels of"}

Sollecito, meanwhile, said he was never at the house, but was at his apartment, watching a movie on his computer with Knox. Later, he told investigators he did not remember whether Knox was with him the entire night.\n\nDefense lawyers are expected to argue that the physical evidence was tainted by sloppy police work.\n\nThe case is being heard by a panel of eight judges.

Relatives have said Hasan tried unsuccessfully to leave the military early -- requests that may have come after Hasan contacted Hendi.\n\nThe cleric said he did try to help Hasan in his search, thinking of women he knew to whom he could introduce the Army psychiatrist, but he never heard from Hasan again.\n\nAuthorities say Hasan opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood Army Post on November 5, killing 13 people. Hasan, who was seriously wounded in the incident, was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder -- charges that make him eligible for the death penalty.\n\nTwo other imams have told CNN similar stories about Hasan's search for a wife, and about his conservatism and apparent devotion to Islam -- but those accounts seem to be inconsistent with behavior Hasan exhibited in the last few months.\n\nThe manager of a strip club near Fort Hood has told reporters that Hasan visited the club a handful of times, staying for several hours each time.\n\n\"You know, for me, everything that he did is against the teachings of Islam.

He's a loner, he avoids women basically, has few friends, and then grafted onto that, he finds sort of a jihadist ideology as a way of making sense of everything, and he decides to martyr himself.\"\n\nBergen and other experts say Hasan could be someone who engaged in what they call \"self-radicalization\": the idea that militant religion might provide an answer to psychological problems that someone already has.\n\nHasan remained hospitalized in Texas, paralyzed from the waist down, his lawyer said.

{"ideal": ["18"], "context": "Tuwaitha, Iraq (CNN) -- The shell of former Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein's efforts to produce a nuclear bomb is being slowly dismantled along the banks of the Tigris River, but its radioactive legacy lingers on.\n\nThe Tuwaitha research complex, about 18 kilometers (11 miles) southeast of Baghdad, was bombed by Israel in its 1981 airstrike on Iraq's Tammuz 1 research reactor. It was bombed again during the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and it was looted extensively after the 2003 U.S. invasion that ousted Hussein.\n\nNow, engineers and technicians are working to dismantle the laboratories and equipment at the site, but the extensive contamination left behind complicates their work.\n\n\"It is difficult because of the destruction,\" said Anwar Ahmed, the project manager at Tuwaitha. \"This facility was bombed in 1991. Now, finally the decision was made to decommission all the destroyed facilities.\"\n\nWorkers and visitors have to wear protective suits and masks around the facility, where about 20 people are at work so far. Iraq's ministry of Science and Technology said it is training more specialists to decommission the facility, but acknowledged the cleanup could take decades.\n\n\"We have 18 facilities in Tuwaitha,\" said Fuad al Musawi, Iraq's deputy science and technology minister. \"We have another 10 facilities around the country. So you can imagine how long it will take.\"\n\nIraq's nuclear ambitions date back to the 1960s, when it obtained a Soviet-built research reactor. It built another, French-designed reactor in the 1970s. Israel's concerns about the program led to the 1981 raid, in which Israeli pilots flew across then-hostile Jordan and a corner of Saudi Arabia to strike the facility.\n\nDespite the damage inflicted by that attack, Iraq began attempting to produce enriched uranium -- a step toward producing a nuclear weapon -- during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, the U.S.-led Iraq Survey Group reported in 2004. It accelerated that program after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait left it facing an international military coalition that ultimately drove out the Iraqi forces.\n\nThe bombardment that accompanied the 1991 war inflicted extensive damage to the Tuwaitha plants. The U.N. sanctions and inspections imposed after 1991 forced Hussein's government to abandon its nuclear program, the ISG concluded.\n\nAfter the 2003 invasion, which was launched after the United States incorrectly accused Iraq of having restarted its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs, nearby Iraqis inflicted further damage by looting the unguarded facility. Villagers nearby complained of symptoms that local doctors attributed to radiation sickness, particularly from using containers taken from the plant to store drinking water.\n\nThe Iraq Survey Group found basements full of radioactive water in some of the buildings, and the U.S. military later spent $70 million ensuring the safe transportation of 550 metric tons of non-weapons grade uranium oxide -- known as \"yellowcake\" -- to Canada.\n\nSome Iraqi scientists still hope to start a civilian nuclear energy program in the future.

{"ideal": ["two-year"], "context": "(WIRED) -- Apple's decision to not include a camera in the new iPod Touch is somewhat surprising. After all, there is already a perfect camera for the job, and it sits inside the iPhone.\n\nBy not adding a camera to its iPod Touch, Apple may boost sales of its iPod Nano.\n\nThat Apple included a video camera inside the iPod Nano makes this more inexplicable still -- the Apple of today is clearly happy to put cameras into its media players (unlike the first iPhone, whose camera was so poor we thought it was just a petulant capitulation to cellphone norms).\n\nLeaving the camera out is also a clear signal not to upgrade the Touch, as -- apart from a larger 64GB model -- the only hardware change is the juiced-up processor, making the iPod Touch run faster like its older brother the iPhone 3GS.\n\nPerhaps Apple is putting the Touch on a two-year update plan like the iPhone, letting people keep their pocket computers for a little longer than usual.\n\nHad the Touch included a camera, I would be knocking on the store doors right now to buy one, along with 64GB ready to be filled with photos and video.\n\nSo the excitement falls to the Nano, which, sports a new shiny coating, a 640 x 480 video camera (no stills) and a larger screen on the outside, and an FM radio on the inside with a Tivo-esque live-pause feature. The radio itself is odd enough, and the first to be included in any iPod. More on that in a moment.\n\nThe Nano's video camera was introduced with reference to Flip's own tiny, no-zoom camcorder. There are two Flip camcorders at the 8GB Nano's $150 price: the 2GB Mino and the 4GB Ultra. To get 4GB and 8GB you jump to $200. The 16GB Nano costs $180.\n\nWhy would somebody buy a Flip? The easy, one button recording, perhaps (with the Nano, you need to go to a menu item to open the video camera application), but that's it. Take a look at the sample videos at the Apple store and you'll see that the Nano's quality is easily \"good enough.\"\n\nThere is another surprise in there, too. The tiny Nano frame has a chip big enough to add real-time effects to video. Gimmicky, but as we guess this is aimed at the teenage market, a nice feature.\n\nThe Nano is the fitness iPod, too, and in this guise it makes another piece of hardware obsolete: The shoe-mounted Nike+ dongle. The Nano comes with the Nike+ software, with workout history, power songs and the like, but the accelerometer now works as a pedometer, counting your steps to flab-loss. You can also connect it to a Nike + iPod compatible cardio-machine via the dock connector.\n\nOne mystery remains, though. Why would Apple put an FM tuner into an iPod, something it has refused for almost ten years? The answer comes with iTunes-Tagging. In addition to live pausing of the radio stream (and rewinding up to 15 minutes through the buffer) you can tag tracks by hitting the center button.\n\nIf a radio station supports it, the song info is saved and later you can see a list in iTunes alongside, you guessed it, the option to buy the song. Of course, the fact that the new Zune HD has an HD radio inside may also have influenced Apple's decision.\n\nSo now I'm torn. Do I buy a new Touch to replace my current model which has a loose headphone connection, or should I get the Nano, with its video camera and sport-friendly features?\n\nIf Apple had piled the features onto the Touch, the decision would be made, and Apple would have $400 of my money.

Justice officials said those involved in the decade-long scheme are from Germany, Switzerland, Argentina and other countries.\n\nAccording to the indictment, the Siemens executives paid millions in bribes in 1994 to secure a bid to create a national identity card system in Argentina. After the project faced suspension in 1999, the defendants are accused of promising even more bribes to the next presidential administration to keep the project afloat. To top it off, once the project met its demise in 2001, Siemens filed an arbitration claim against Argentina claiming wrongful termination of the contract and seeking $500 million in lost profits. The company hid from the proceedings that it had illegally acquired the contract in the first place, the indictment said.\n\nJustice Department officials praised Siemen's cooperation and said the company that has 60,000 employees in the United States played a large and cooperative role in exposing the alleged conspiracy.\n\nThe eight indicted men include Uriel Sharef, former member of the central executive committee of Siemens AG; Herbert Steffen, former CEO of Siemens Argentina; and Andres Truppel, former CFO of Siemens Argentina.\n\nAlso named in the indictment are Ulrich Bock, Stephan Signer and Eberhard Reichert, former senior executives of Siemens Business Services; and Carlos Sergi and Miguel Czysch, who were agents of Siemens in the alleged bribe scheme.\n\n\"There were few lines these executives were not willing to cross,\" said Robert Khuzami, director of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Lanny A.

Under state law in such incidents, only a summons is to be issued and the motorist is to be allowed to go. Instead, detectives detained Moore for almost an hour, arrested him, then searched him and found cocaine.\n\nAt trial, Moore's lawyers tried to suppress the evidence, but the state judge allowed it, even though the court noted the arrest violated state law. A police detective, asked why the man was arrested, replied, \"Just our prerogative.\"\n\nWhile some of the justices expressed concern about that level of discretion at oral arguments in January, their 9-0 ruling raised few such doubts.\n\n\"The arrest rules that the officers violated were those of state law alone,\" Scalia said. \"It is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce state law.\"\n\nThe state had argued an arrest is constitutionally reasonable if officers have probable cause to believe a suspect has committed a crime. \"This standard represents the best compromise between the needs of the citizens and the duty of the government to combat crime,\" Stephen McCullough, Virginia's deputy solicitor general, had told the high court.\n\nBut Moore's attorney, Thomas Goldstein, called an \"extreme proposition\" the idea that it would be reasonable \"to go out and arrest someone for a non-arrestable offense and not only do that, but having committed that trespass at common law, to further search them.\"\n\nThere has been widespread judicial confusion over how such police searches should be handled. Some lower courts had ruled that when state arrest law is violated, the Constitution provides a remedy in the suppression of any evidence resulting from the arrest and a related search.\n\nBut the justices agreed with the majority of courts that said constitutional requirements are satisfied when an officer has probable cause to make an arrest, even if some provision of state law was violated in the process.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a concurring opinion suggesting Virginia change its law to make driving on a suspended license an arrestable offense.\n\nDuring arguments, Ginsburg spoke for several colleagues when she pointed out that if a summons had been issued in Moore's case, any incriminating evidence would have been excluded. \"Would you explain the logic to saying that when the police violate state law, then the evidence can come in, but when they comply with state law, it can't,\" she asked.\n\nThe ruling means Moore's original jury conviction and 3-½ year prison term will stand.

But when the history of Hollywood's 21st century embrace of 3-D is written, it very well may point to this weekend as the moment when the format definitively established its commercial power at the box office.\n\n\"The Final Destination\" scared up by far the most box office receipts, banking $28.3 million.\n\nDespite a moviegoing weekend dominated with R-rated violent thriller-type films ostensibly shooting for the same audience, \"The Final Destination\" scared up by far the most box office receipts, banking $28.3 million for an easy No. 1 berth, according to early estimates from Hollywood.com Box Office.\n\nThat's almost $10 million better than the opening frame for the last film in the creatively-dispatching-model-perfect-unknown-actors franchise (which, for those keeping track, was \"Final Destination 3\").\n\nThere's really only one reason why: Although just over half its 3,121 theaters were screening the flick in 3-D, fully 70 percent of its box office take was from 3-D theaters, which typically charge an extra few bucks per ticket for the privilege of watching the film with those comfy stereoscopic glasses. Rest assured, despite its title (and its abysmal \"C\" Cinemascore grade), this is by no means the final \"Final Destination\" movie.\n\nThe folks at the The Weinstein Company, meanwhile, continue to enjoy good news for their much scrutinized bottom line: Quentin Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\" landed at No. 2 with a rather spectacular $20 million, just 47 percent down from its opening weekend for $73.7 million total.\n\nTWC's sister company Dimension Films, meanwhile, saw its \"Halloween II\" debut at third with a nothing-to-sneeze-at $17.4 million. Granted, director Rob Zombie's second re-imagining of the 31-years-old slasher franchise made nothing close to the $30.6 million Labor Day weekend debut of Zombie's first night out with Michael Myers.\n\nBut given the steep competition, and the film's $15 million budget, Dimension must be breathing a sigh of relief that their film will most likely see a decent profit.\n\nThe box office love continued through much of the weekend's top 10: District 9 dropped just 41 percent with $10.7 million, strong enough to hold on at fourth place and, with a $90.8 mil running total, well on its way to joining the $100 million club.\n\nAt number five, \"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\" banged out $8 million, a 34 percent drop and $132 million total. And Julie & Julia savored a tiny 16 percent drop for sixth, with $7.4 million in its forth weekend for $70.9 million total.\n\nIn fact, the only true disappointment for the weekend was Focus Features' \"Taking Woodstock.\" Director Ang Lee's trip back to the iconic three-day concert debuted at ninth with just $3.7 million, doubly disappointing since it opened wide in 1,393 theaters (after a Wednesday opening in New York and Los Angeles), with a feeble $2,691 per theater average.\n\nBy contrast, two limited release debuts did rather well: Vogue magazine documentary \"The September Issue\" bowed on six screens with a very fashionable $40,000 per theater average; and the extreme-sports-fandom-gone-wrong dramedy \"Big Fan\" won $13,000 per theater on two screens.\n\nCLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly", "question": "Which film landed at number two?"}

That's what happened in Mexico in the 1990s. Commandos from the Mexican army deserted and set up a cartel, known as Los Zetas.\n\nThe U.S. government says Los Zetas is \"the most technologically advanced, sophisticated and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico.\"\n\nLos Zetas are blamed for last week's brutal killings of the police chief in the southern Mexican city of Veracruz, his wife and four children. The way in which the killers carried out their crime sent a message.\n\nAt 5 a.m. on July 29, two cars pulled up in front of the police chief's house, and eight or nine gunmen got out, armed with assault rifles and 40 mm grenade launchers. They blasted their way into the house, and it took them less than five minutes to execute Jesus Antonio Romero, his wife, also a police officer, and their son. The gunmen then set the house on fire, killing the remaining three children, all girls.  Watch scenes of the escalating drug war in Veracruz »\n\nWith their fierce weaponry and military expertise, Los Zetas are considered the most formidable enemy in the drug war.\n\n\"The Zetas have obviously assumed the role of being the No. 1 organization responsible for the majority of the homicides, the narcotic-related homicides, the beheadings, the kidnappings, the extortions that take place in Mexico,\" said Ralph Reyes, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's chief for Mexico and Central America.\n\nThe fight against Los Zetas will take years, Reyes said.\n\n\"They continue to train new recruits through several campaigns. One of them is the very open and public narco banners that they post around the country of Mexico, specifically tailored to the military and [saying] that they will offer better pay and better benefits if they join the ranks of the Zetas,\" Reyes said from his Washington office, where he directs the U.S. battle against Los Zetas.\n\nWith its mastery of combat, Reyes said, the organized crime network operates more like a U.S. infantry company patrolling the streets of Falluja, Iraq, than a street gang.\n\nNewspapers in Veracruz have headlines almost every day about drug cartels' bloody violence, more often than not linked to Los Zetas. The DEA said that although the group originally was based on military lines, the cartel has been built into a business structure, with quarterly meetings, business ledgers, even votes on key assassinations.\n\nAnd now Los Zetas are taxing businesses beyond their drug reach -- from human trafficking across the U.S. border to, as one recent scandal showed, imposing a kind of tax on the Mexican government. The state oil company has been bleeding billions to corrupt officials linked to Los Zetas.\n\nAnd, as a DEA agent recently said, the American border makes no difference to Los Zetas.

The trials will measure the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine.\n\nThe research is a first step toward U.S. health officials' goal of developing a safe and effective vaccine against H1N1, also known as swine flu, which has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization\n\nThe time frame for developing a vaccine is a tight one.\n\n\"It's going to be close,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. \"I believe it can be [ready by October] if things run smoothly. We hope they will, but you never can tell when you're dealing with biological phenomena like making vaccines and administering them.\"\n\nThe announcement of the U.S. trials followed the announcement earlier this week, by an Australian company, CSL Ltd., of the first human trials of a swine flu vaccine.\n\nConcern about the H1N1 virus grew after it spread quickly around the globe earlier this year.\n\n\"This virus has the potential to cause significant illness with hospitalizations and deaths during the U.S. flu season this fall and winter,\" said Dr. Karen Kotloff, professor of pediatrics and lead investigator and researcher at Maryland's Center for Vaccine Development. \"Vaccines have always been a vital tool for controlling influenza. The results of these studies will help to guide the optimal use of the H1N1 vaccines in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.\"\n\nAfter careful screening, volunteers will be inoculated and then asked to keep a diary on how they feel. After eight days their blood will be checked and after 21 days they will receive another dose, followed again by diary logs and blood tests.\n\nPatients will be monitored two months for safety issues, followed by a four-month and six-month checkup.\n\n\"The purpose of these trials is always to make sure they are safe,\" Kotloff said. \"But even after six weeks, if things look good, we're pretty sure the vaccine will work.\"\n\nShe noted the response to the vaccine may vary in different age groups. \"This is because young people have not seen a flu virus like this one before,\" she noted. \"Older adults might have some immunity to the new H1N1 virus as a result of being exposed to similar flu viruses in the past. As a result, older adults might need fewer doses or a lower strength of the vaccine than younger individuals.\"\n\nThe vaccine at this point has been tested only in animals, where it has shown to be effective. Further trials will examine questions such as how the vaccine works in combination with the seasonal flu vaccine and whether including an adjutant, a substance that boosts the immune response to vaccines, can make it work better at lower doses.\n\nOther trial sites along with the University of Maryland Medical Center are Baylor College of Medicine, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Emory University, Saint Louis University, Seattle Group Health Cooperative, the University of Iowa, and Vanderbilt University.

Below are excerpts from that interview.\n\nCNN: What inspired you to get involved with Oxfam?\n\nKristin Davis: Oxfam is unique in helping people become independent. That's their goal.\n\nOne of the reasons I got involved was that after the tsunami, I remember all of the fishermen whose entire lives had gotten washed away in Indonesia. I thought, \"How are they ever going to get their livelihoods back?\" Oxfam was committed to staying there until those fishermen got their own livelihoods back together so that they could be self-sufficient..\n\nCNN: You are specifically interested in helping women receive job training and education. Why is that important to you?\n\nDavis: A lot of times, these women have been left alone or their husbands have died of AIDS or different things. I was interested in helping women who may live in a world where they weren't trained to do anything and they weren't afforded an education. Oxfam will go into these communities and try to help out.\n\nIt might be raising chickens, it might be sewing beaded necklaces; they're helping the women empower themselves. And, especially for women, that's a huge, huge life-changing thing to be able to be self-sufficient. The women can then support their children, and usually the women send their children to school and it changes the next generation.\n\nCNN: What is your role as an ambassador?\n\nDavis: The way I perceive my role as an ambassador -- which I think is personal for everyone -- is that I travel to places that I'm interested in, where there's a story or a particular situation with women usually, and I just talk to people and I'm a witness to their story. I come back and try to tell their stories.\n\nJust going is such an inspiration for me that I would do it (if) no one asked me at all. But it's wonderful for me to be able to talk about it to other people, because I think sometimes we're not aware of how other people are living.\n\nCNN: What is a hero to you?\n\nDavis: I think right now our world is somewhat chaotic. There's a lot to be upset about and a lot to complain about, and the heroes are the people who are getting up and doing something about it. That's what I love about the CNN Heroes program: that it's people all over the world who may just be on their own trying to fix something. And I think that's great.\n\nIt's great to be able to support people who are involved in maybe a small-scale way, trying to make the world better.

On the flip side, such massive reorganizations typically involve political compromises that could affect its performance.\n\nThe second option -- an \"agency within an agency\" -- could involve less short-term disruption, but could be hindered by a \"lack of clarity of a single mission,\" the report says.\n\nRAND also suggests a range of actions short of reorganization that could improve domestic intelligence gathering, such as increasing resources, improving leadership and changing bureaucratic cultures.\n\nThe report does not assess the FBI's performance since 9/11, Treverton said, but he believes Congress should seek an independent assessment.\n\nA panel of experts that RAND convened guessed that the probability of a terrorist attack had decreased about one-third since the September 11, 2001.

Less than a week after the report, YouTube screen shots and pictures -- reportedly of the grandson -- have been plastered on the news in South Korea.\n\nSouth Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported that it had tracked down photos of the grandson from the Bosnian school's Facebook page and published the pictures. The young man appears in photos wearing a suit and black horn-rimmed glasses posing with a woman at what appears to be a party.\n\nIn another photo, the young man sports a blonde hairdo and is wearing a black T-shirt on the streets. The news agency reported Kim's nationality on the school website was set as North Korean. The school, the United World College in Mostar, confirmed its acceptance of a 16-year-old North Korean student named Kim Han-sol through a press release but stopped short of confirming the identity of the individual.\n\n\"The entry of a student from North Korea, furthermore from a very well-known family, has understandably generated surprise and comment, some of it critical,\" it said in a statement.\n\nAccording to Yonhap News Agency, Kim Han-sol is the son of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il's oldest son, Kim Jong-nam. Kim Jong-nam is the family's most outspoken member and has been seen at airports and other venues outside of North Korea. He is viewed by many as the outcast of the Kim family. It is believed the oldest Kim fell out of favor when he was stopped in Japan trying to enter on a forged passport on his way to Disneyland in 2001.\n\nThe South Korean media has also focused on YouTube postings that Yonhap News Agency says feature Kim Han-sol. Yonhap released shots in which the YouTube user claims to be a North Korean studying in Macau. The person also claims to be \"related (to the Kim family).\"\n\nCNN could not independently confirm the identity of the YouTube user or the person shown in the pictures in the South Korean media.

A photograph once released as an exclusive shot of one of the leader's sons later turned out to be an average South Korean man.

While that problem has been corrected using a back-up system, NASA managers have decided the computer needs to be completely replaced in order to keep a fully redundant back-up capability available.\n\nA spare computer was built prior to Hubble's launch in 1990, and has been warehoused at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland ever since. Initially, engineers had hoped that spare could be quickly tested, certified \"flight ready,\" and shipped to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to be packed aboard Atlantis in time for a February launch.\n\nBut a closer evaluation of the spare shows more than six months of work will be needed to get it ready to fly.\n\nAmong other issues, it was partially disassembled other the years so that parts could be used for other systems.

{"ideal": ["Verizon"], "context": "(WIRED) -- The iPhone 4S is available on three major carriers, leaving potential buyers to wonder whether AT&T, Verizon or Sprint is the better network choice.\n\nPricing plans aside, carrier quality is a significant factor in anyone's purchasing decision, and now consumers have hard data to help them choose: A just-released study reports AT&T is tops for fast data speeds, while Verizon is the most reliable when it comes to making phone calls.\n\nSprint's main draw is that it offers unlimited, albeit slow, data.\n\nThe study was performed by Metrico Wireless, a mobile device performance analytics firm. To test network performance, Metrico made 6,000 voice calls, conducted 8,000 data download/upload tests (both moving and stationary), and downloaded more than 21,000 web pages.\n\nThe tests found that Verizon dropped calls 2.1 percent of the time, while AT&T dropped 2.8 percent of calls and Sprint lost 3.7 percent of calls. The average dropped-call rate for the entire mobile industry is 1.4 percent. Although Sprint dropped the most calls, it had the highest call quality on the uplink (outbound calls), while AT&T had the best downlink call quality (inbound calls).\n\nWith regard to maximum data speeds, AT&T led the pack at 6,047Kbps, with Verizon a distant second at 2,371Kbps, and Sprint crawling in last with only 1,767Kbps. It's unclear, however, exactly where Metrico tested data bandwidth, and as any iPhone-toting San Francisco resident will tell you, data quality can be terrible in areas with high concentrations of tech geeks.\n\nThe original iPhone launched exclusively with AT&T, which was the sole carrier of the iPhone until Apple announced that Verizon would also begin carrying the iPhone 4 in January 2011. Prior to the launch of the iPhone 4S, rumors swirled that the phone would land on Sprint, and ultimately proved true. Of the three carriers, Sprint is the only one that provides a true unlimited data plan.\n\nMetrico's results are consistent with what we found back when Verizon began offering the iPhone 4: AT&T offered better download speeds, while Verizon had better coverage.\n\nAnother important stat Metrico found was that the iPhone 4S performed perfectly across all three networks when it came to data task reliability. In short, 100 percent of the time, the phone was able to complete web-page loads, stationary downloads, and stationary uploads. This contrasts with an earlier Metrico study from March 2011 that found Verizon had a higher download success rate when the phone was stationary, and AT&T had a higher rate while the phone was moving.\n\nSo what's the bottom line? It looks like you're going to get a relatively positive data-downloading experience no matter which carrier you choose, if only because you will be able to download data. But if you value downloading material quickly, you should go with AT&T. If call reliability is paramount, stick with Verizon, and if you want to use a lot of data but don't care about speed, go with Sprint.\n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

That's what happened in Mexico in the 1990s. Commandos from the Mexican army deserted and set up a cartel, known as Los Zetas.\n\nThe U.S. government says Los Zetas is \"the most technologically advanced, sophisticated and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico.\"\n\nLos Zetas are blamed for last week's brutal killings of the police chief in the southern Mexican city of Veracruz, his wife and four children. The way in which the killers carried out their crime sent a message.\n\nAt 5 a.m. on July 29, two cars pulled up in front of the police chief's house, and eight or nine gunmen got out, armed with assault rifles and 40 mm grenade launchers. They blasted their way into the house, and it took them less than five minutes to execute Jesus Antonio Romero, his wife, also a police officer, and their son. The gunmen then set the house on fire, killing the remaining three children, all girls.  Watch scenes of the escalating drug war in Veracruz »\n\nWith their fierce weaponry and military expertise, Los Zetas are considered the most formidable enemy in the drug war.\n\n\"The Zetas have obviously assumed the role of being the No. 1 organization responsible for the majority of the homicides, the narcotic-related homicides, the beheadings, the kidnappings, the extortions that take place in Mexico,\" said Ralph Reyes, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's chief for Mexico and Central America.\n\nThe fight against Los Zetas will take years, Reyes said.\n\n\"They continue to train new recruits through several campaigns. One of them is the very open and public narco banners that they post around the country of Mexico, specifically tailored to the military and [saying] that they will offer better pay and better benefits if they join the ranks of the Zetas,\" Reyes said from his Washington office, where he directs the U.S. battle against Los Zetas.\n\nWith its mastery of combat, Reyes said, the organized crime network operates more like a U.S. infantry company patrolling the streets of Falluja, Iraq, than a street gang.\n\nNewspapers in Veracruz have headlines almost every day about drug cartels' bloody violence, more often than not linked to Los Zetas. The DEA said that although the group originally was based on military lines, the cartel has been built into a business structure, with quarterly meetings, business ledgers, even votes on key assassinations.\n\nAnd now Los Zetas are taxing businesses beyond their drug reach -- from human trafficking across the U.S. border to, as one recent scandal showed, imposing a kind of tax on the Mexican government. The state oil company has been bleeding billions to corrupt officials linked to Los Zetas.\n\nAnd, as a DEA agent recently said, the American border makes no difference to Los Zetas. It doesn't matter if violence is perpetrated on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border.\n\nInside the United States, one of the instruments of assassination Los Zetas unleashed was teenager Rosalio Reta. Given six months of military training in Mexico, he was sent across the border to target rival drug gangs. He was 13 years old when he committed his first killing.\n\n\"I loved doing it,\" Reta says in a police interrogation tape. \"Killing that first person, I loved it.

Now, she's been killed, the latest victim of what you could call \"junk justice.\"\n\nWhen Chelsea went running in a San Diego, California, park, it's doubtful she had any idea that another young female runner had been attacked in that very same park just a couple of months before.\n\nThat first victim said she feared her attacker was going to rape her. She managed to get away by elbowing the large man in the nose.\n\nIf there were falling rocks in that park, a warning sign would be up. If a hungry coyote had been spotted scrounging for food, a warning sign would tell you.  But there was no warning at all that a human predator, on the hunt for young women, might be in the park. If there had been a sketch of this suspect, or a warning posted, Chelsea might not have gone running alone there.\n\nPolice said DNA on Chelsea's underwear led them to 30-year-old John Gardner III. They showed his picture to the first runner and she said, \"He's the same guy.\" Now he's been charged with Chelsea's rape and murder.\n\nThe suspect was a registered sex offender. In 2000, he lured a 13-year-old girl into his home on the pretext of watching the movie \"Patch Adams.\" Once he got her inside, he molested her and beat her to a pulp before she escaped.\n\nBefore Gardner was sentenced, a psychiatrist warned that he showed no remorse and would likely attack a young girl again. He recommended \"the maximum sentence allowed by law.\"\n\nThe courts sentenced Gardner to six years; he got out after five. Five years for pummeling a 13-year-old girl in the face and fondling her. That is \"junk justice.\"\n\nIf Gardner had been prosecuted to the full extent of the law then, he would have been behind bars when Chelsea went for a run on February 25. Her grieving mom spoke directly to this point to Larry King Thursday night...\"I mean how many times do our daughters need to be raped before we put these monsters behind bars forever? I just don't -- I don't get it. Change has to be made. And I know that there are people out there that are -- that are trying to, you know, get this change in place. And Brent and I are committed for the rest of our lives to be a part of that.\"\n\nWe need to switch our focus from punishment to prevention. Our system only kicks into high gear after the fact. In this case, a warning sign, something that simple, would have cost a fraction of the millions it might take to prosecute and house the killer. A warning sign that a woman had been attacked in the park could have possibly saved Chelsea's life.\n\nIn California, for every one parole officer there are 70 criminals.  Companies like Google, FedEx, and eBay use high-tech systems to track packages and information. We already have the technology in the form of ankle bracelets to track the sex predators so why not use it?\n\nThink about this. We can carefully track the delivery of a package across the country but don't keep track of a sex offender who weighs more than 200 pounds.

All social niceties go out the window in a free for all that's best avoided completely.\n\nTaxis During the day traffic can be gridlocked, but in the evening, when traffic is lighter, taxis are reasonably alternative to the subway. Enter and exit taxis by the back left-hand door. Don't make the novice's error of trying to open or close the door -- your white-gloved driver will do that from the front seat.

He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan, the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself.\n\nWitnesses and local officials have blamed the younger Ampatuan, a longtime ally of the Philippines president and a known warlord. They said the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging him in the May gubernatorial election.\n\nAlso killed were a dozen journalists who had accompanied the women.\n\nViolence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media.\n\nMaguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.\n\nSuspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims.\n\nCNN's Talia Kayali contributed to this report.", "question": "What was invoked to impose peace?"}

That's what happened in Mexico in the 1990s. Commandos from the Mexican army deserted and set up a cartel, known as Los Zetas.\n\nThe U.S. government says Los Zetas is \"the most technologically advanced, sophisticated and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico.\"\n\nLos Zetas are blamed for last week's brutal killings of the police chief in the southern Mexican city of Veracruz, his wife and four children. The way in which the killers carried out their crime sent a message.\n\nAt 5 a.m. on July 29, two cars pulled up in front of the police chief's house, and eight or nine gunmen got out, armed with assault rifles and 40 mm grenade launchers. They blasted their way into the house, and it took them less than five minutes to execute Jesus Antonio Romero, his wife, also a police officer, and their son. The gunmen then set the house on fire, killing the remaining three children, all girls.

The DEA said that although the group originally was based on military lines, the cartel has been built into a business structure, with quarterly meetings, business ledgers, even votes on key assassinations.\n\nAnd now Los Zetas are taxing businesses beyond their drug reach -- from human trafficking across the U.S. border to, as one recent scandal showed, imposing a kind of tax on the Mexican government. The state oil company has been bleeding billions to corrupt officials linked to Los Zetas.\n\nAnd, as a DEA agent recently said, the American border makes no difference to Los Zetas. It doesn't matter if violence is perpetrated on the Mexican or U.S. side of the border.\n\nInside the United States, one of the instruments of assassination Los Zetas unleashed was teenager Rosalio Reta.

As part of that plea agreement, she agreed to cooperate with the state and federal cases against her husband, Brian David Mitchell, federal prosecutors have said.\n\nBarzee and Mitchell were accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy, Utah, in the company of Barzee and Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who calls himself Emmanuel and had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home.\n\nThe month after Smart was kidnapped, prosecutors alleged, Barzee and Mitchell attempted to break into the home of her cousin, but were unsuccessful. The girl was 15 years old at the time, according to CNN affiliate KSL.

Critics said that in the lead-up to the attacks, the FBI devalued counterterrorism agents and failed to heed signs that an attack was imminent.\n\n\"If you didn't carry a gun, you didn't count so much,\" Treverton said.\n\nAfter the attacks, the FBI moved to transform its primary mission from law enforcement to counterterrorism intelligence and prevention. It now focuses on terrorism through its National Security Branch and the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nThe RAND report focuses on two options to the current system.\n\nIn one, a new agency would be created using intelligence agencies from the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and intelligence community. A second option is to create an \"agency within an agency\" in the FBI or DHS.\n\nThe first option would result in an organization with a clear, unambiguous mission, and might be able to draw on a more diverse recruitment pool, such as linguists and historians who are not normally attracted to law enforcement. On the flip side, such massive reorganizations typically involve political compromises that could affect its performance.\n\nThe second option -- an \"agency within an agency\" -- could involve less short-term disruption, but could be hindered by a \"lack of clarity of a single mission,\" the report says.\n\nRAND also suggests a range of actions short of reorganization that could improve domestic intelligence gathering, such as increasing resources, improving leadership and changing bureaucratic cultures.\n\nThe report does not assess the FBI's performance since 9/11, Treverton said, but he believes Congress should seek an independent assessment.\n\nA panel of experts that RAND convened guessed that the probability of a terrorist attack had decreased about one-third since the September 11, 2001. But \"they were not enthusiastic about alternatives\" to current counterterrorism organizations.\n\nIn a cautionary note, the report says that while public acceptance of domestic intelligence activities is imperative, public attitudes about what is considered acceptable \"can both be fragile and shift significantly over time.\"\n\n\"Public demand for domestic intelligence is driven by the perceived threat, and those perceptions can change much more rapidly than the threat itself,\" the report says.

Be sure to order the moose meat burger.\n\nA vibrant club scene exists in Malmo, which is home to Slagthuset (Jorgen Kocksgatan 7A) -- the largest nightclub in Scandinavia. Young dancers spread out over three dance floors at the club located behind Central Station. As its name suggests, Club Prive (Malmborgsgatan 7) draws an exclusive crowd.\n\nTo chill in style, head to Torso Twisted (Vastra Varvsgatan 44) in the hip Western Harbor district. The restaurant serves gastronomic delights, and at night the lounge is decidedly cool. Indulge in one of the lavish cocktails or sample from the impressive wine list.\n\nYou can also find the trendy set partying the evening away at Hipp (Kalendegatan 12). You can hang out in the restaurant or two bars or head straight to the pulsating nightclub.\n\nSatisfy your thirst for beer at Tva Krogare (Storgatan 35). The pub dishes up traditional Swedish fare and you'll likely find locals playing a game of darts. For a taste of British in Malmo, try The Bishop's Arms (Norra Vallgatan 62). Located inside the Hotel Savoy, it serves staples like fish and chips and has a wide assortment of beers available.\n\nIf parties begin in Lilla Torg, they tend to end in Mollevangen. The bohemian neighborhood is dotted with bars that stay open well into the night. Prices in this area aren't as cheap as they once were but are still lower than compared to what you'll find in the city center.\n\nLocal musicians hang out at hip Tempo Bar and Kok (Sodra Skolgatan 30). For something a little different, try Chokladfabriken (Bergsgatan 33), a club housed in an old chocolate factory that plays mostly hip hop, funk and soul.\n\nMalmo's passion for music makes it a great place to take in live performances. Kulturbolaget (Bergsgatan 18), one of the best venues for live acts, is a veritable Swedish institution. The club puts on about 220 rock concerts annually. Inkonst (Bergsgatan 29), a so-called culture house, puts on shows and club evenings. Jazz enthusiasts get into their groove at Jeriko (Spangatan 38), named such because it's housed in a former church.\n\n....................

The researchers examined the meters used in San Francisco, California, but the same and similar electronic meters are being installed in cities around the world.\n\n\"It wasn't technically complicated and the fact that I can do it in three days means that other people are probably already doing it and probably taking advantage of it,\" said Joe Grand, a designer and hardware hacker and one of the hosts of the Discovery Channel's \"Prototype This\" show. \"It seems like the system wasn't analyzed at all.\"\n\nGrand and fellow researcher Jake Appelbaum presented their findings Thursday afternoon at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. The researchers did not contact the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency or the meter maker prior to their talk, and asked reporters not to contact those organizations ahead of their presentation, for fear of being gagged by a court order.\n\nAt last year's DefCon hacker conference, MIT students were barred from talking about similar vulnerabilities in smartcards used by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority after the MBTA obtained a restraining order. They spoke with Threat Level about their findings prior to the presentation.\n\n\"We're not picking on San Francisco,\" Grand said. \"We're not even claiming to get free parking. We're trying to educate people about ... how they can take our research and apply it to their own cities if they are trying to deploy their own systems or make them more secure.... Cities all over the nation and all over the world are deploying these smartcard meters [and] there's a number of previously known problems with various parking meters in other cities.\"\n\nSan Francisco launched a $35-million pilot project in 2003 to deploy smart meters around the city in an effort to thwart thieves, including parking control officers who were skimming money from the meters.\n\nThe city estimated it was losing more than $3 million annually to theft. In response, it installed 23,000 meters made by a Canadian firm named J.J. MacKay, which also has meters in Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Canada, Hong Kong and other locales.\n\nThe machines are hybrids that allow drivers to insert either coins, or a pre-paid GemPlus smart card, which can be purchased in values of $20 or $50. The machines also have an audit log to help catch insiders who might skim proceeds.\n\nTo record the communication between the card and the meter, Grand purchased a smartcard shim -- an electrical connector that duplicates a smartcard's contact points -- and used an oscilloscope to record the electrical signals as the card and meter communicated.\n\nHe discovered the cards aren't digitally signed, and the only authentication between the meter and card is a password sent from the former to the latter. The card doesn't have to know the password, however, it just has to respond that the password is correct.\n\nThe cards sold in San Francisco are designed to be thrown out when the customer has exhausted them. But the researchers found that the meters perform no upper-bounds check, so hackers could easily boost the transaction limit on a card beyond what could legitimately purchased. They could also program a card to simply never deduct from the transaction count.\n\n\"We're residents of San Francisco and our taxes are going towards a broken system that they could potentially be losing money on and we pay the consequences of that,\" Grand said.\n\nSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

Yes, reading the details of the treatment of the dogs, including the killing of some of them, could make anyone sick. Yet what's the point of sentencing someone to jail, then having them serve their time and be released if we still want to imprison them for the rest of their lives?\n\nFrankly, I'm sick of Americans who talk all day about \"do the crime, then do the time,\" then still want to treat a man like a criminal when he gets out of prison.\n\nThis doesn't just apply to Michael Vick. Look at all the individuals who are sent to prison, get out and then can't find a job. Why? Because they have the Scarlet Letter on their record, which is a big fat \"F\" for felon. Don't think I'm looking for any sympathy for someone who goes to jail. I firmly believe that you deserve all that you get for breaking the law. But listening to some of these zealots go on and on and on about Vick needing to continue to be punished is ridiculous!\n\nThe judge in Vick's case has imposed a number of restrictions. One of them is that he can't ever own a dog again. OK, gotcha. But to say the man shouldn't be allowed to play in the NFL is D-U-M-B. The crimes of which he was convicted had nothing to do with playing sports.\n\nRemember Wall Street star Michael Milken? When he was sent to jail for securities fraud, he was banned from working on Wall Street again. I get that. He was an insider and allowing him back into the financial game would have been atrocious.\n\nI get it when someone is convicted of molesting children that they can't live within a certain distance of a school or be left alone around children when released. But there is nothing related to Vick's crime that says he should not be allowed to play professional football.\n\nWhat is particularly galling is that, right now, you have any number of football players who have beaten people -- including their wives and girlfriends -- served time for drunk driving or committed other crimes, yet they have resumed their careers. The same goes for teachers, radio and television broadcasters, politicians and others.\n\nSo is this any different because it involved dogs? Are we to say that the horrible treatment of dogs is vastly different than mistreatment of human beings? The critics will likely say, \"These men are role models. Kids look up to them. They should have no business on the field.\" Yet some of these same kids are living with fathers and mothers who are felons. So are we supposed to remove them from the home as well?\n\nEnough with the public bullying. Vick was sentenced and served his time. And now he's gotten out. If you want to be angry with him, fine. But please, cut the sanctimonious crap. He deserves to make amends and get on with his life.

Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China, until a Communist uprising proved victorious in 1949.\n\nThe $5.3 billion arms package, announced last month, includes upgrades to Taiwan's F-16 fighter fleet.\n\nLast year, a similar deal prompted China to temporarily cut off military to military relations with Americans. This time, aside from some strong objections voiced by Beijing, Panetta said there has been no tangible action taken in response by China. \"I've heard nothing that indicates that they're taking any steps in reaction to that,\" Panetta said.\n\nPart of the reason might be the way the United States government handled the sales. \"It was something that the United States had announced but we had given the Chinese a heads up as to what was going to take place,\" Panetta said. \"I think in the end ... they handled it in a professional and diplomatic way and we appreciate that. \"\n\nThe South China Sea, a body of water east of Vietnam, north of Malaysia and west of the Philippines, has been a source of regional tensions for decades. But because of recent discoveries of massive oil reserves as well as its importance to regional maritime and aviation navigation, tensions have increased recently. Many countries lay claims to the same parts of the sea.\n\nAfter his meeting with the Indonesian defense minister, Panetta met with defense ministers from all eight member nations of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes all the nations that border the South China Sea, except China.\n\nIn remarks prepared for the start of the meeting, Panetta said, \"I applaud the July accord between ASEAN and China on implementing guidelines to the 2002 declaration on the conduct of parties in the South China Sea. I would encourage you to maintain this momentum, and continue working towards a binding code of conduct.\"\n\nBut Panetta said there are still some concerns regarding China's military that bear watching.\n\n\"Obviously there are some concerns about some of the things they are doing on modernization, there are concerns about some of the things they are doing with some of the more sophisticated weapons that have been developed.\"\n\nHe said China being open and letting the world know what its military is doing is key. \"As long as they are transparent, as long as we can discuss these issues on a frank and direct basis then I think we can develop a strong working relationship.\"\n\nHe ended his discussion of China with the reporters on an ominous note about positive relations. \"I think it would be in the interest, not only in the interest of both nations, but also in the interest of the security of the world.\"", "question": "Which country did the U.S. sell arms to?"}

The idea we use the sun's energy to grow plants and then make fuels from those plants is essentially a good one,\" Dr. Long said.\n\n\"It's been tainted by the fact that the easy way to do it is to just use food crops, but society needs to realize there are big opportunities beyond food crops and beyond the use of crop land.\"\n\nMiscanthus, for instance, is able to grow on land too marginal for crop production, so it doesn't have to compete with land for food crops. It also doesn't require major input or fertilization after planting and once established will yield for around 15 years.\n\nYet even with the success of these trials in the U.S. and the earlier European ones, it could be years before the full potential of Miscanthus is realized.\n\nThis is due in part to the fact that it's much more complex to make cellulosic ethanol -- ethanol made from non-food plants -- than it is to turn simple food starches found in corn or wheat into ethanol.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Miscanthus is recognized by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as an energy crop and it's currently being used to co-fire the Drax power station in England's Yorkshire.\n\nEven still, Dr. Geraint Evans from the UK's National Non-Food Crops Centre said rather than plants like Miscanthus, wheat grain will be used to meet the UK target of replacing five percent of fuel with renewable sources by 2010.\n\n\"Miscanthus has the potential to be more efficient, producing between 4,000 and 7,000 liters of fuel per hectare, whereas ethanol made from wheat grain makes about 1900 liters per hectare.\"\n\n\"Wheat grain-derived ethanol is what we can do today with the technology we have available today. The technology to use Miscanthus is not yet commercially available,\" Dr. Evans told CNN.\n\nIn addition to the technical hitch, Dr. Evans said a further downside is that even though Miscanthus is a low maintenance crop, it can be costly to plant compared to wheat or rapeseed canola and the first yield wouldn't occur for at least three years.\n\nIn an effort to overcome some of the challenges, Dr. Long now intends to turn his attention to experimenting with the wild Miscanthus used in the U.S. trial.\n\nAnd if the sort of improvements made to corn in the last 50 years are any indication, Miscanthus could be well be used to fuel the future in a matter of years.

I would expect that this is how and what our cinema is all about.\"\n\nIf Indian films have gained a new found international interest, the way that Indian films are produced has also changed.

Shell confirmed an attack on that pipeline and said it had shut it down to avoid an environmental impact. Chevron, which halted its onshore operations in the region last month, said it was investigating.\n\nLast month, the militant group declared an \"all-out war\" on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians.\n\nIt is not the first declaration of war by MEND, which demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be invested in the region instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians.\n\nThe militant group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks.

Only trace amounts of water were found in rocks and soil brought back to Earth, and that water may have resulted from contamination during the retrieval process, scientists said.  Watch report on discovery of more sources of moon water »\n\nMustard was on a team led by Carle Pieters, science manager of the NASA-supported Keck Reflectance Experiment Laboratory at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nPieters also is principal investigator for NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), which the space agency contributed to India's first mission to the moon, Chandrayaan-1, in October 2008. The mapper was a \"state-of-the-art imaging spectrometer\" that provided the first map of the entire lunar surface at high resolution, revealing the minerals of which it is made.\n\nExamining data from Chandrayaan-1, Pieters' team found signs of water at the moon's frigid poles. The researchers believe it might have migrated from elsewhere on the moon's surface, attracted by the cold, they said.\n\nTheir overall findings also were confirmed by data from a high-tech spectrometer on the Cassini spacecraft -- which also found evidence of water at lower latitudes away from the poles -- and from infrared mapping done by the Deep Impact spacecrafts -- which found trace amounts over much of the moon's surface.\n\nReports on those findings came from teams led by Roger Clark of the U.S. Geological Survey and Jessica Sunshine of the University of Maryland.\n\nThis most recent information is far more precise than any previous data, Mustard said. Previous measurements were \"the size of Texas, say, and now are the size of Providence.\"\n\n\"We find it (water) distributed more broadly,\" he added.\n\nIn the late 1990s, scientists found pockets of hydrogen on the moon, and inferred that its molecules could bond with oxygen to make water, the professor said. He called the older information much coarser.\n\nThis time, researchers are reassured that the components are on the moon to make water because of the presence of hydroxyl -- produced when hydrogen and oxygen also bond with a mineral structure.\n\nThe researchers said the results also suggest that the molecules are continually being created on the lunar surface, perhaps as a result of the solar wind -- the stream of ionized particles ejected by the sun.\n\nThe research reports were being posted Thursday by the journal Science, at the Science Express Web site, www.sciencexpress.org, and will be in the magazine that comes out Friday.\n\nA news conference on the findings is scheduled for Thursday afternoon in Washington.", "question": "What is in the lunar soil?"}

However, she continued to lag behind her classmates and was cited as a disruptive influence in the classroom because she often had to ask a fellow student for help.\n\nThe girl's mother, also named Miram Flores, and other minority parents claimed school officials in Nogales, a border town about 70 miles south of Tucson, did not provide enough money to get English-deficient students up to speed in writing and reading comprehension.\n\nIn 2000, a federal judge agreed, concluding Arizona violated the Equal Educational Opportunities Act, and ordering the state to rework its plan and increase funding. The English Language Learner (ELL) program was then placed under federal oversight.\n\nOn Thursday, a divided Supreme Court dismissed the 17-year-old lawsuit, but ordered a federal judge to review whether Nogales officials are \"providing equal opportunities\" to mainly Spanish-speaking students in the community.\n\nArizona maintained the federal court injunction delayed its plans to fix the system. It maintained it has provided enough resources to improve its ELL program, allowing it to end federal oversight.\n\n\"Injunctions of this sort bind state and local officials to the policy preferences of their predecessors,\" wrote Justice Samuel Alito for the majority.\n\nSome legislators claim a 2006 state law essentially eliminated long-standing funding inequities. But parents say officials continue to drag their feet when it comes to complying with an appropriate classroom model for non-English-speaking students.\n\nArizona says it increased more than twofold the amount of money it spends per non-English-speaking pupil, and that it has complied with the No Child Left Behind Act, the sweeping public classroom accountability act passed in 2002 that ties federal education funding to improvements in measurable student achievement.\n\nThe current dispute has pitted the GOP-led state legislature and the school superintendent against the Democratic governor and attorney general, along with civil rights and teacher groups.\n\nAlito said a federal law guaranteeing equal opportunity in public schools \"is a vitally important one, and our decision will not in any way undermine efforts to achieve that goal.\" He added that if state officials ultimately prevail in their reform efforts, \"it will be because they have shown that the Nogales School District is doing exactly what this statute requires -- taking appropriate action to teach English to students who grew up speaking another language.\"\n\nAlito was backed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.\n\nBut in a lengthy dissent -- parts of which were read from the bench -- Justice Stephen Breyer said the ruling was \"misguided,\" calling it \"a mistaken effort to drive a wedge between review of funding plan changes and review of changes that would bring the state into compliance with federal law.\" He was backed by Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter.\n\nThe divided court seemed poised to issue a narrow ruling, fact-specific to the ELL plan in Nogales. But groups on both sides of the issue asked the high court for broader guidance on settling state-federal conflicts involving institutional reform mandates, especially those involving disadvantaged groups.\n\nSuch political turf battles often end up in the courts, and can lead to decades of federal oversight, such as the fight over school desegregation beginning in the 1950s. Against that backdrop is the continuing fight over immigration and the responsibility of states to fund the education of illegal immigrants and their children.\n\nMiriam Flores is now an adult and a student at the University of Arizona.\n\nThe cases are Horne v.

Until 1723, Christie's said, all diamonds worn by European royalty came from India.\n\nThe diamond has a royal lineage. Christie's traces it thus: King Philip IV of Spain (1605-1665) selected the diamond in 1664 as part of a dowry for his daughter, the Infanta Margarita Teresa (1651-1673). She had become engaged to Leopold I of Austria (1640-1705), who later became Holy Roman Emperor.

Michael, who would ascend higher than any black artist in music history, learned a bitter lesson: Even at the top of the mountain, there is only the man in the mirror.\n\nJason isn't old enough to fully understand black and white, why his grandmother was sent to jail for ordering a hamburger at a Woolworth lunch counter in 1960, or how an ill-used child's soul might never find its way back home.\n\nSo I told Jason about the time Mommy, Grandma, Grandpa, Aunt Lydia and Aunt Johnita [now an assistant general counsel at CNN] drove from Miami to Jacksonville to see the Jacksons' Victory Tour in 1984, when Michael Jackson ruled the world. How his aunties and I dressed up for the concert in our own gloves.\n\nAfter the concert, still floating from the surreal experience, we approached a stretch limousine on the highway.

{"ideal": ["knee"], "context": "(CNN) -- Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez insists Fernando Torres is happy at the English Premier League club after Manchester City were linked with a multi-million dollar bid for the Spain striker.\n\nTorres has scored 18 goals in 22 league games for Liverpool this season but will miss the rest of the campaign after having surgery on a knee injury, meaning the 26-year-old faces a race to be fit for Spain's opening game in the World Cup against Switzerland on June 16.\n\nCity spent over $100 million in the transfer market before the start of this season and are currently battling for fourth spot in the league, which would guarantee a lucrative Champions League place.\n\nLiverpool, meanwhile, sit in seventh place and look set to miss out on qualification for the money-spinning tournament. It has led to speculation that Torres could be top of City's wanted list once the season ends.\n\nCity's Italian manager Roberto Mancini told reporters: \"We are a top team and I think all the top teams are interested in Torres but sometimes it depends on the player because they want to play in the Champions League.\n\n\"For me, he is with Carlos [Tevez], [Wayne] Rooney, [Lionel] Messi, [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic, [Cristiano] Ronaldo as the best in Europe. Fernando is a fantastic striker; all the teams in Europe would like him.\"\n\nThe City manager did admit a successful pursuit of Torres may only come about if the club can secure Champions League football next season: \"If we don't get into the fourth position I think it will be difficult,\" he said.\n\nLiverpool were knocked out of Champions League in the group stages but have progressed to the semifinal of the Europa League against Atletico Madrid. They lost the first leg 1-0 in the Spanish capital on Thursday.\n\nAfter the game Benitez dismissed the possibility of Torres leaving the club. He told reporters: \"Torres is happy. The thing he's thinking about now is being ready as soon as possible and that's it. From the beginning, he's said he's been very happy at Anfield.\n\n\"We have said repeatedly that Fernando is not for sale and he still has three years of his contract remaining, so how can they sign a player who does not wish to leave?\"", "question": "where has torres an injury?"}
{"ideal": ["Brazilian striker"], "context": "(CNN) -- Manchester City have confirmed that absent Brazilian striker Robinho will be back in time for the Premier League side's return to training next week.\n\nRobinho had a reputation for partying prior to his British-record transfer to Manchester City last August.\n\nCity manager Mark Hughes told the club's official Web site that Robinho, who cost mega-rich City a British record fee of £32.5 million ($45m) when he signed from Real Madrid in August, will be spoken to after not joining the rest of the squad in a Tenerife training camp this week -- choosing instead to fly to Brazil to attend to a family matter.\n\nHughes told mcfc.co.uk: \"Robbie left without permission, he felt that he had personal things that he needed to attend to.\n\n\"He made the decision to leave the camp, and go back to Brazil. That was not with my permission, and the situation at the moment is not really practical to get him back here with time differences and length of flights, so he will be back at the weekend ready to train when we are back in Manchester at the first available opportunity.\n\n\"Once he is back, I will sit down with him and explain my feelings, and decisions will be made after that. He has rung me, and he understands that we need to address this -- and we will. Then we will move on.\n\nRobinho's decision to fly to Brazil came on the same day that City announced they were pulling out of a world record transfer move for AC Milan star Kaka, a Brazilian team-mate of Robinho. However. Hughes has insisted that that two matters are completely unrelated.\n\nRobinho is no stranger to controversy and had a reputation as a party-goer prior to his move to Manchester last year.\n\nHe was dropped by his former Madrid coach, and now England national coach, Fabio Capello, who questioned his attitude and Robinho's eventual departure from the Spanish club was acrimonious.\n\nIn fact, in October 2007, Robinho failed to return to Madrid after appearing for Brazil in an international match, claiming he had missed his flight.\n\nLocal newspapers later revealed that he had been seen partying in a popular Rio de Janeiro nightclub and he was subsequently fined and dropped by the club.", "question": "Who is Robinho?"}

These attacks include the abduction and murder of two resident U.S. citizens in Chihuahua.\"\n\nMore than 16,000 people have died in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after assuming office in December 2006. Ciudad Juarez, in Chihuahua state across the border from El Paso, Texas, is the most violent city in the nation.\n\n\"The situation in the state of Chihuahua, specifically Ciudad Juarez, is of special concern,\" the alert says.\n\n\"Mexican authorities report that more than 2,600 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez in 2009,\" the report states. \"Additionally, this city of 1.3 million people experienced more than 16,000 car thefts and 1,900 carjackings in 2009. U.S. citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in Ciudad Juarez, avoid isolated locations during late night and early morning hours, and remain alert to news reports.\"\n\nBut the problems are not limited to Juarez, the State Department says.\n\n\"Mexican drug cartels are engaged in violent conflict -- both among themselves and with Mexican security services -- for control of narcotics trafficking routes along the U.S.-Mexico border,\" the report says. \"In order to combat violence, the government of Mexico has deployed military troops throughout the country. U.S. citizens should cooperate fully with official checkpoints when traveling on Mexican highways.\n\n\"Some recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small-unit combat, with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades. Large firefights have taken place in towns and cities across Mexico, but occur mostly in northern Mexico, including Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, Chihuahua City, Nogales, Matamoros, Reynosa and Monterrey. During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area.\"\n\nA number of areas along the border continue to experience a rapid growth in crime, with robberies, homicides, petty thefts and carjackings increasing during the past year nationwide, the alert says.

Travelers on the highways between Monterrey and other parts of Mexico to the United States (notably through Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros) have been targeted for robbery and violence and have also inadvertently been caught in incidents of gunfire between criminals and Mexican law enforcement.

{"ideal": ["Both sides in the dispute", "school district", "the school district"], "context": "(CNN) -- A Mississippi lesbian Tuesday won a judge's backing for her contention that her First Amendment rights were violated when her high school refused to allow her to attend her prom with her girlfriend.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge Glen H. Davidson refused to order the Itawamba County School District in Fulton, Mississippi, to hold the dance it had canceled over the matter.\n\nIn his 12-page order, Davidson also ruled that Itawamba Agricultural High School's denial of 18-year-old Constance McMillen's request to wear a tuxedo to her prom was a violation of her rights.\n\n\"The record shows Constance has been openly gay since eighth grade and she intended to communicate a message by wearing a tuxedo and to express her identity through attending prom with a same-sex date,\" Davidson wrote.\n\n\"The court finds this expression and communication of her viewpoint is the type of speech that falls squarely within the purview of the First Amendment.\"\n\nWhen school officials told McMillen she could neither take her girlfriend to the prom nor wear a tuxedo to the event, the senior went to the American Civil Liberties Union, which demanded the school change its policy. In response, the school district canceled the prom altogether.\n\nDavidson denied a motion for an injunction filed by McMillen against the school district's superintendent, the school's principal and its assistant principal asking the court to order that the April 2 prom be reinstated, saying that parents were planning a private event to be held on that date for all students, including McMillen.\n\nRequiring school officials \"to step back into a sponsorship role at this late date would only confuse and confound the community on the issue,\" he said.\n\nRead the judge's opinion (PDF)\n\nBoth sides in the dispute were happy with the outcome.\n\n\"It vindicates Constance's rights,\" said Christine Sun, senior counsel with the ACLU's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender project.\n\n\"It sets a legal precedent for gay and lesbian students all over the country that they have the right to bring a same-sex date to the prom and also to wear gender-nonconforming clothes to the prom. We were looking for a ruling that what the school did was violate her rights,\" Sun said.\n\nSchool board attorney Michele Floyd said the school district was also pleased with the decision.\n\nShe said the parent-sponsored event, which may be called a ball instead of a prom, is to be held in Tupelo, 19 miles away.\n\nBut ACLU's Sun said McMillen had not received an invitation. \"We haven't heard anything about this private prom other than what this school district has told us,\" she said. \"It remains to be seen whether she will be able to attend the private prom.\"\n\nMcMillen's case is going forward on a damages claim and the ACLU's request for attorneys' fees, she said. \"She got what she wanted, and now it's just a question of what the damages might be in her case.\"\n\n\"I never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together,\" McMillen said last week in an ACLU news release. \"A lot of people have made really generous offers to pay for a prom somewhere else, which I really appreciate. But all I've ever wanted was to be able to just go to my own school's prom with my girlfriend.\"\n\nAt the center of the lawsuit is a February 5 memorandum from the school to students that said prom dates must be of the opposite sex.\n\nSuperintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence, according to the documents.", "question": "who is pleased with the decision?"}

{"ideal": ["discuss bringing peace to Darfur", "peace in Darfur"], "context": "(CNN) -- One week in Darfur, the next week at the White House. That's the role of a peace activist -- one that actor George Clooney embraces.\n\nActor George Clooney met with Vice President Joe Biden on Monday to discuss bringing peace to Darfur.\n\nHis battle to bring peace to Darfur brought him to the White House on Monday, where he met with President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe actor appeared on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" later on Monday to discuss his activism.\n\n\"I actually met with the president in the Oval Office for about 15 minutes,\" Clooney told King, adding that they'd worked together on Darfur three years ago, holding a news conference on the issue when Obama was a U.S. senator. The actor met separately with Biden on Monday.\n\n\"They've been very involved\" in Darfur, Clooney said. \"Vice President Biden has been incredibly vocal on the issue.\"\n\nClooney, a longtime Darfur activist and a Messenger of Peace for the United Nations, was in Darfur last week with journalists Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times and Ann Curry of NBC.\n\n\"I think somehow we should all know that these people are hanging on by the skin of their teeth,\" Clooney told King of his visit.\n\nThe government of Darfur has waged a brutal counter-insurgency against militias for the past six years, a war that some international critics have characterized as genocide.\n\nAn estimated 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat, disease or malnutrition, according to the United Nations. An additional 2.7 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of fighting among rebels, government forces and the allied Janjaweed militias.\n\nClooney said of his conversations with Obama and Biden: \"Basically, we were just talking about coming back from Chad and right on the border of Darfur. And we were talking about there's a moment coming up relatively soon -- probably by the middle of next week -- where the International Criminal Court is going to indict the president of Sudan for war crimes, which has never happened before -- a sitting president.\"\n\nLast year, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was charged with genocide by the International Criminal Court for the government's campaign of violence in Darfur.\n\nThe violence erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Khartoum government. Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength.\n\nUnder pressure to end the fighting, Al-Bashir in November agreed to an immediate and unconditional cease-fire in Darfur.\n\n\"This isn't about needing American dollars,\" Clooney said of the push for peace in Darfur. \"I understand that it's a very difficult time. It's not about needing American troops. It's about needing what we do best -- what we have done best since the start of this country -- which is good, robust diplomacy all across the world.\"\n\nThe priorities, as Clooney advocated to Obama and Biden:\n\n-- An envoy working full time on bringing peace to Darfur -- someone \"getting up every morning with their sole job to find peace in the area,\" he said.\n\n-- Persuading China to leverage its investment muscle in Darfur to push for peace.\n\n-- Pressing Egypt, the African Union and Europe to strengthen diplomatic efforts in the region.\n\n\"Diplomacy has to start and it has to be aggressive and it has to start soon. We have an opportunity here,\" Clooney said.", "question": "What did the actor call for?"}
