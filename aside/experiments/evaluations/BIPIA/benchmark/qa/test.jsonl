{"ideal": ["Kindle Fire", "the \"Kindle Fire"], "context": "(CNN) -- Color is coming to the Kindle.\n\nAt least that's what the tech blogosphere expects to happen on Wednesday at an Amazon press conference.\n\nThe maker of the world's most popular e-book reader is rumored to be announcing a color, touch-screen tablet device called the \"Kindle Fire,\" according to the blog TechCrunch, which claims to have seen the gadget.\n\nHere are the Kindle Fire's specs, according to that site and others:\n\n-- 7-inch color screen, compared to 6-inch for current Kindles\n\n-- Wi-Fi only (no 3G version)\n\n-- Touch-screen navigation\n\n-- Glowing LED screen instead of paper-like e-ink\n\n-- Android operating system\n\n-- Hits stores in November\n\n-- Current Kindle will remain on sale\n\nThe Kindle tablet is remarkably similar to BlackBerry's PlayBook tablet, says Ryan Block at the blog GDGT, and that's because both were built and designed by the same manufacturing company. Block, who cites unnamed sources, says Amazon used the design for the unpopular BlackBerry tablet as a starting point.\n\nEven though details about the device haven't been confirmed, Block and other bloggers are already throwing water on the Kindle Fire.\n\n\"Although Amazon did refresh the ID of their PlayBook derivative, I'm told that this first tablet of theirs is 'supposed to be pretty poor' and is a 'stopgap' in order to get a tablet out the door for the 2011 holiday season -- which doesn't exactly leave the best taste in my mouth,\" he writes. \"But it's also not the most uncommon story, either: when you're breaking into a new market, sometimes you have to do whatever it takes to get in the game. You may remember how crappy the original Kindle was compared to later models!\"\n\nThree major magazine companies have signed on to provide content for the new Kindle tablet, according to Peter Kafka at the blog network AllThingsD, which is owned by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nHearst, Conde Nast and Meredith will sell digital versions of their magazines on the upcoming Kindle tablet; but Time Inc., which shares a parent company with CNN, will not settle on a deal this week, Kafka says.\n\nAll of this is just conjecture for now, of course.\n\nAmazon's press conference is scheduled for 10 a.m. Wednesday in New York. Many details should become clearer then.\n\nBarnes & Noble, one of Amazon's competitors in e-books, is expected to announce a new version of its Nook color e-reader later this year.", "question": "as the Amazon tablet will be called?"}

He was convicted of lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor, attempted sexual assault with a minor and other related charges.\n\nHe showed no reaction as the verdict was read after more than four hours of jury deliberations, according to KLAS. Sentencing was set for May 8.\n\nThe crime triggered a national manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007.\n\nJurors in Stiles' trial viewed the videotape, but the judge would not allow members sitting in the gallery to view it, and a screen was put up to block the jury box, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts. Some members of the media were allowed to view the tape as well, but the judge did not want the reactions of reporters or the public to influence jurors, he said.\n\nThe charges also related to another girl who Stiles was accused of sexually assaulting on videotape.\n\nThe tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted.\n\nAfter attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007. An attorney for her mother said she was 7 years old and safe and healthy.\n\nThe rape occurred before the girl's third birthday, while she was in the care of a baby-sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized. After the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture.\n\nIn an appearance on \"The Dr. Phil Show,\" the girl's mother said the girl has no recollection of the assault.\n\nStiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate, and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance.\n\nStiles eventually admitted who he was and that he was being sought, authorities said.\n\nThe man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed it to others.\n\nA judge gave Tuck a one-year suspended sentence and three years of probation in April after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct a public officer, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers.\n\nBrooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- In 2008, the world cast its eyes on Beijing, the sprawling Chinese metropolis that was set to play host to the Summer Olympics.\n\nAt VBS.TV, we caught wind of another story that soon had our full attention. As Chinese officials were taking unprecedented and often controversial measures to sanitize the notoriously foul Beijing air, much of the rest of the country was still covered in a thick blanket of noxious smog.\n\nAccording to a World Bank survey at the time, 16 of the world's 20 most-polluted cities were in China.\n\nAt the top of that list is the city of Linfen, a coal-mining and manufacturing hub in the heart of Shanxi Province. Within weeks, we assembled a film crew and went off to the landlocked province in northern China to find out more.\n\nAfter touching down in Beijing and making a quick visit to the Olympic countdown clock, we set out to visit the single most polluted place on Earth, hoping to place the dubious ranking into a human context.\n\nDespite the Chinese government's promise of a marathon-friendly city, the Beijing air at the time was still plenty oppressive. But nothing could have prepared us for the dystopian scenario we encountered during our week in Linfen and the surrounding area.\n\nSee the rest of Toxic Linfen at VBS.TV\n\nBefore the trip, I had researched thousands of images of the pollution that plagues Linfen and Shanxi province, but to see it in person is, quite simply, devastating.\n\nThe sun sets before it is supposed to, disappearing into a curtain of smog above the true horizon. Residents scavenge the roadside for coal that falls from the seemingly endless cavalcade of coal trucks, gathering it with bare hands. Schoolchildren play against the nonstop backdrop of billowing exhaust. Many of the elderly have trouble speaking between gasps of widespread emphysema.\n\nResidents of Linfen are aware of the growing threat the polluted air and water pose, and some of them have left the city. Most, however, have no choice but to stay.\n\nThe infamy of a No. 1 ranking in the news media eventually motivated China to focus more attention on cleaning up Linfen, but unfortunately, the scene of overwhelming pollution is still rampant in many parts of the country.\n\nAs easy as it is to criticize China's bold industrial development, our visit was also a clear reminder of the same pattern of manufacturing and consumption that has occurred elsewhere since the dawn of the Industrial Age.\n\nIn China, it just happens to be on a much grander scale and on the back of a globalized economy that has rendered China into an assembly line for the world. The most compelling research I came across to this end are recently published studies showing particulate matter from China's factories and mines reaching across the Pacific Ocean to North America's West Coast.\n\nChina obviously has some cleaning up to do, and more importantly, some major strategizing to achieve a sustainable economy.\n\nOur futures are inextricably linked. Back in New York City, the coal mines of Shanxi Province feel worlds away, but as oil now gushes ceaselessly into our own backyard, we should pay even more attention to Linfen if we don't want it to be a glimpse into our own future.", "question": "What does the city of Linfen have?"}

The women who got the supplements, compared with those taking a placebo, had a 34 percent lower risk of developing any form of AMD, and a 41 percent lower risk of more severe forms of AMD.\n\nEpidemiologist and study author William G. Christen, Sc.D., of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, expects that if these findings are successfully replicated in future studies, \"the combination of these vitamins might become the first prevention method of early stages of age-related macular degeneration other than avoiding cigarette smoking.\"\n\nChristen also noted that although the study was conducted among women age 40 and older, there is no particular reason to believe the same results would not hold true in a similar group of men.\n\nChristen and his colleagues examined the role of vitamins B6 and B12 and folic acid in AMD partly because previous studies have shown these vitamins are known to lower levels of homocysteine, an amino acid found in the blood that when elevated has been associated with higher risks of AMD.\n\nThe 5,442 women who participated in the randomized, double-blind clinical trial already had heart disease or at least three risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The majority of them did not have AMD at the start of the study, which lasted more than 7 years. Christen explains that the underlying mechanism of AMD likely involves the vascular system, and researchers widely believe that cardiovascular disease and AMD share common risk factors.\n\nAge-related macular degeneration is a vision disease common among people older than 60, involving the deterioration of tissues in the macula, the central part of the retina. The condition impedes the performance of critical everyday functions such as reading and driving because it affects the ability to see items that a person is looking at directly, as opposed to items even a few degrees off to either side of the direct line of vision.\n\n\"If you affect that central part of your vision, no one goes blind from it but it really interferes with your quality of life,\" explains Dr. Roy Rubinfeld, ophthalmologist and spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.\n\nThere are two types of macular degeneration: wet and dry. Wet forms of AMD are caused by abnormal blood vessels growing beneath the macula, which can rupture and bleed. The dry form is generally caused by cells in the macula degenerating over time and thus losing function.\n\nWhile some treatments do exist for the wet form of the disease (including laser surgery, photodynamic therapy and injections into the eye), there is currently not much in the way of treatments for the more common dry form.\n\nWhen asked if the study results mean that people at high risk for AMD should begin taking a vitamin supplement that provides vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid, retina specialist Dr. Robert Frank of the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggests probably not yet.\n\n\"If you do anything, I would take a supplement of antioxidant vitamins containing high doses of vitamins A, E, C and zinc,\" suggests Frank, who has no financial interest in the vitamin supplement industry. These antioxidant vitamins were found to prevent the progression of age-related macular degeneration in the 10-year Age-Related Eye Disease Study conducted by the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nHowever, Frank does say that while it still remains to be seen whether people currently taking a multivitamin containing the B vitamins and folic acid will be able to prevent early AMD from developing -- answers which will probably not be found for several years, after a large-scale clinical trial is begun -- there is little risk for most people in taking a daily multivitamin.", "question": "What might B vitamins help to prevent?"}

She was an adviser to Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign last year.\n\nCarly Fiorina says outrage at Wall St. pay is justified but salaries shouldn't be set by government.\n\n(CNN) -- Americans are outraged over excessive CEO pay and perks. That outrage is justified, particularly when American taxpayers are footing the bill.\n\nOur capitalist system works best when there is transparency and accountability. There has been too little of both on Wall Street.\n\nInevitably, the president and Congress are now attempting to respond to taxpayer anger and restore some \"common sense,\" as President Obama recently declared, to CEO compensation. The proposed solution caps top executive pay at $500,000 for institutions that have received bailout money.\n\nI don't think this is the answer, although it is an understandable reaction. It's arbitrary: Why not $400,000 or $600,000? It's incomplete. It only applies to institutions that will receive more government assistance going forward. And it doesn't strengthen our economy when government decides how much each job is worth. In America we leave that job to markets.\n\nSo what's the answer? To strengthen transparency, all aspects of CEO pay and perks should be fully disclosed on a regular basis. This should include airplanes, cars, golf-club memberships, bonuses, stock options, retirement plans and salaries -- in short everything that a common-sense person would consider part of a CEO reward package. See Fiorina discuss exec pay, including her own »\n\nTo strengthen accountability, all aspects of CEO compensation should be voted on by shareholders on an annual basis.\n\nUltimately, it is the owners of a company who must determine whether a CEO's rewards are justified by a CEO's performance. And because the American taxpayer is now a partial owner in many companies, the government can get a vote as well -- in some cases a very sizeable vote.\n\nIn addition, \"clawback provisions,\" which require a CEO to return compensation to shareholders if promised results aren't delivered, should be standard fare.\n\nFinally, when a company comes to Washington for American taxpayer money, it is an admission that mistakes have been made and major bets have failed. These CEOs should be prepared to tender their resignations and those of their boards. To earn a bailout, a CEO and board should be held accountable.\n\nWe should not weaken our economy while trying to fix it. These are difficult times. President Obama has described our current situation as a \"crisis\" and an impending \"catastrophe.\" In such times, action is required. The key is to take actions that help in the short-term, while also being sensible for the medium and long-term.\n\nToo often our politicians react to crisis and public anger by over-reaching, and they create new, unforeseen problems that only become clear with the passage of time.\n\nIn this country, the opportunity to be rewarded for taking prudent risk is fundamental to our economic vitality and strength.

The officer, Greg Carter, 21, said he saw Peterson exit the building with a rifle, and momentarily lost sight of him. Then, Carter \"heard multiple rounds of gunfire\" and Carter's windshield burst, Van Hollen said.\n\nVan Hollen said Peterson drove \"aimlessly\" through three Wisconsin counties and made false calls to authorities to \"throw police off his tail.\"\n\nHe eventually stopped in Argonne, Wisconsin, where he spoke to friends and confessed, Van Hollen said.\n\nPeterson was killed in a shootout with law officers Sunday after negotiations for his surrender failed.

{"ideal": ["melanoma"], "context": "LONDON, England  -- A new drug for melanoma has been shown to rapidly shrink malignant tumors in an early trial at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York.\n\nNew drug inhibits BRAF, the main driver of mutation in over 50 percent of melanomas.\n\nAmong 27 patients whom the experimental new drug was tested on, \"19 showed a 30 percent or greater reduction in tumor size,\" Dr. Paul Chapman, the lead researcher told CNN from a cancer conference in Berlin.\n\nMelanoma develops in cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color, and is the most serious type of skin cancer.\n\nCurrently the standard treatment for metastatic malignant melanoma is chemotherapy, which has only a 15 percent success rate, Chapman explained. In his trial using PLX4032 over 70 percent of patients had a response to the drug.\n\n\"Without reservation we can say this is a breakthrough in melanoma. We haven't seen a major breakthrough in this disease in the last 40 years,\" said Professor Alexander Eggermont, President of the European Cancer Organization.\n\nSeventy-five percent of the patients who were treated with PLX4032 had already received multiple treatments of other cancer drugs, all of which had failed. Two-thirds of those patients also already had what Eggermont described as \"very widespread metastatic disease.\"\n\n\"There were patients who were on oxygen or on continuous morphine who were off the morphine after one or two weeks of treatment,\" Eggermont told CNN. Two patients, he said, even showed complete remission, such that all detectable melanoma \"melted away.\"\n\nThe other two major benefits of PLX4032 are that it can be taken orally as a pill and seems to have very mild side effects.\n\nThe PLX4032 complex works by blocking the activity of cancer-causing mutation of the BRAF gene, which is implicated in more than half of all melanomas. Eggermont praised the drug for being highly-selective unlike traditional \"dirty\" cancer drugs that have a wide range of side-effects.\n\n\"The side effect profile looks very mild and we think it's because it's such a clean, super selective molecule and it's an oral drug, and that's a great asset,\" he said.\n\nPeter Hirth, CEO of the drug's maker Plexxikon explained that it is because PLX4032 is such a highly selective compound that \"doctors can adjust the dosage to really shut down tumors,\" whereas other cancer treatment drugs are frequently limited from working to their full potential because patients cannot tolerate their toxicity levels.\n\nPLX4032 is not a cure, but offers hope for alleviating symptoms and extending life.\n\n\"I've never seen this before in melanoma,\" Chapman said referring to the successful findings. \"One thing we don't know is how long these response are going to last,\" he added.\n\nThe next step will now be to test the drug in a larger trial of almost 700 people, scheduled to begin this month and to be completed by the end of the year.\n\nThen a randomized test comparing chemotherapy treatment with PLX4032 therapy will need to occur before. Currently that is slated to take place across North American, Europe and Australia in the first quarter of 2010.\n\n\"We are working to make sure that within the shortest time possible we will satisfy the needs of FDA to get this drug available to melanoma patients as quickly as possible,\" Eggermont said.\n\nEarly responses from peers have been supportive. In a statement Dr. Kat Arney said that \"Cancer Research UK and others have been investigating drugs that can block faulty BRAF, so it is interesting to see the results from a small-scale trial of such a drug. Melanoma is a very difficult cancer to treat and the results of this early-stage trial are promising, but larger trials need to be done before we know for sure how effective this treatment is.\"", "question": "What is the treatment for?"}

Two days later, the platform sank and oil started gushing into the Gulf.
