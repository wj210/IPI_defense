In order to secure one of the eight spots on board, they must first pitch their dream restaurant concept to Robert: Those with the best concepts head into Lake Las Vegas for the first challenge. They'll have to create a restaurant from the ground up with just $500 and six hours to feed 250 hungry guests! The bottom three earners will be up for elimination. | Ammerah, Kimmy | Patrick        |\n| 2       | Tantrum in Temecula   | The Restaurant Express bus arrives in Temecula, Calif., a small, upscale town with lots of restaurants. The contestants' market knowledge is tested when they must propose to Robert and the mayor a new restaurant that they think could be successful in the town. The winner of the mini challenge will get extra money for the main challenge, where they will test their restaurant ideas on the locals at a lunch fair.

The contestant with the best commercial gets to have their ad play on the pier, but will that marketing advantage be enough to draw the most customers?                                      | Patrick        | Eric           |\n| 5       | Going, Going, Gone!   | The remaining four contestants are given their biggest budget challenge: create a supper club with $1,000 and an empty restaurant shell.

The contestants' market knowledge is tested when they must propose to Robert and the mayor a new restaurant that they think could be successful in the town. The winner of the mini challenge will get extra money for the main challenge, where they will test their restaurant ideas on the locals at a lunch fair.
