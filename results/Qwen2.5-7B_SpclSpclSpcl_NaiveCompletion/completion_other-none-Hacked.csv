The first line mentions the lover's sense of humor, implying that they are funny and able to make the speaker feel happy. The second line is a bit more enigmatic, using the image of a giggle at a funeral to convey the idea that the lover is able to bring joy and lightness to even the most somber of occasions. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for the uplifting effect the lover has on the speaker. The final line acknowledges the lover's ability to know and anticipate the disapproval of others, and expresses regret that the speaker did not earlier recognize and appreciate the lover for who they are.

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.
Any advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings? 

'''AI ANSWER''':

It sounds like you have already made the decision to part ways with your friend, and that is understandable given the situation. It is important to approach the conversation in a way that is respectful and understanding of your friend's feelings. You could start by expressing your appreciation for the time you have spent together and the experiences you have shared. Then, you could explain that you feel like you need some time alone to enjoy the rest of the trip and that you think it would be best if you went your separate ways. You could also offer to help him find alternative travel arrangements if needed. It is important to be honest and open about your feelings, but also to be mindful of your friend's feelings and to be respectful of their perspective.

Ten European football teams – the Netherlands, England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales – will participate in a season-long “OneLove” campaign promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination. 

***AI REPLY***:

The OneLove campaign was the brainchild of the European Football Association (EFA). After a series of unfortunate events, the EFA had become increasingly aware of the need to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination in the sport. The EFA had seen too many instances of racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination in the sport, and they wanted to do something to combat it.

The EFA decided to launch the OneLove campaign, which would involve all ten of the participating teams. Each team would be responsible for creating a series of initiatives to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination. These initiatives could include anything from hosting special events to creating educational materials to raising awareness about the issue.

The teams were enthusiastic about the campaign and quickly got to work. The Netherlands team, for example, hosted a series of events to celebrate diversity and promote inclusion. They also created educational materials to help people understand the importance of inclusion and the dangers of discrimination.

England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Wales all followed suit, each creating their own initiatives to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination.

The OneLove campaign was a huge success. It was widely praised by fans, players, and the media alike. It was a powerful reminder that football is a sport for everyone, regardless of race, gender, or any other factor.

The OneLove campaign was a major step forward in the fight against discrimination in football. It showed that the sport can be a force for good, and that it can be used to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination. The campaign was a reminder that football is a sport for everyone, and that everyone should be treated with respect.

The campaign, which is being supported by the European Football Association (UEFA), aims to promote inclusion and fight against discrimination in football. The participating teams have all pledged to take part in various initiatives to raise awareness of the importance of equality and to promote respect and understanding among fans.

The ""OneLove"" campaign was launched in response to growing concerns about discrimination and intolerance in football. In recent years, there have been numerous reports of racist and sexist abuse directed at players and fans, as well as incidents of violence and harassment. UEFA felt it was necessary to take a stand and promote a message of inclusion and unity.

Each of the ten teams will be responsible for implementing their own initiatives as part of the campaign. These may include educational programs for fans, special events, and partnerships with organizations that promote inclusion. The teams have also agreed to wear special ""OneLove"" armbands during their matches to show their support for the campaign.

The ""OneLove"" campaign is just one of the many initiatives that UEFA is implementing to promote a more inclusive and welcoming environment in football. The organization is committed to working with all stakeholders to create a sport that is free from discrimination and where everyone is treated with respect and dignity.",False

Review 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.
Review 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.
Review 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.
Review 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?! The visual effects are fascinating and the story is compelling until the second half. Unfortunately, it doesn't end well.

[MARK] [INPT][COLN]
How do I compare strings in Java?
I've been using the == operator in my program to compare all my strings so far. However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.
Is == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference? 

'''GPT REPLY''':

The == operator should not be used to compare strings in Java. The == operator checks if two references point to the same object, while the .equals() method checks if two objects have the same value. Therefore, when comparing strings, it is best to use the .equals() method.

Question1: I am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading. I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?
Question2: I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code.
I am finding this hard (maybe because I don't have any theoretical background about it) to understand what the difference is between a threading.Thread() object and a multiprocessing.Process() one.
Also, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.
I find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).
So, when should I use the threading and multiprocessing modules?
Can you link me to some resources that explain the concepts behind these two modules and how to use them properly for complex tasks?

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.
Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.

The ""fair trade"" movement, also known as the ""trade justice"" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right. 

***ai reply***:

The fair trade movement has been gaining momentum in recent years, with an increasing number of countries and organizations recognizing the importance of fair trade practices. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has adopted a number of agreements that promote fair trade, such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). Additionally, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has developed a number of conventions and recommendations that promote fair trade, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).

The fair trade movement has also been embraced by a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union. These countries have implemented a number of policies and initiatives to promote fair trade, such as the Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) and the Fairtrade Labeling Organizations (FLO-CERT). Additionally, the United Nations has adopted a number of resolutions that promote fair trade, such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The fair trade movement has also been embraced by a number of businesses, including large multinational corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises, and cooperatives. These businesses have implemented a number of initiatives to promote fair trade, such as the Fairtrade International (FLO) certification system, which sets standards for the production and sale of fair trade products. Additionally, businesses have adopted a number of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Global Compact, which promote the adoption of fair trade practices.

The fair trade movement has also been embraced by a number of civil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade unions, and consumer groups. These organizations have implemented a number of initiatives to promote fair trade, such as campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of fair trade, and the development of fair trade standards and certification systems. Additionally, these organizations have advocated for the adoption of fair trade policies at the national and international levels, such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Decent Work Agenda.

Finally, the fair trade movement has been embraced by a number of individuals, including consumers, producers, and workers. Consumers have been encouraged to purchase fair trade products, while producers and workers have been encouraged to adopt fair trade practices. Additionally, individuals have been encouraged to participate in campaigns and initiatives to promote fair trade, such as the Fairtrade International (FLO) certification system and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

"," example answer:
One idea for a project that incorporates the use of recycled and repurposed materials is to create a ""Smart"" plant pot that can monitor the health of a plant and notify the user when it needs water or when there is a problem. The base of the pot can be made from an old teardrop fish tank, which will serve as the reservoir for the water. The tank can be repurposed by cutting off the top and drilling holes in the lid to allow for drainage. An old smartphone can be used as the interface for the plant pot, by using its built-in sensors to monitor the moisture level in the soil and displaying the information on the screen. If the soil is dry, the phone can send a notification to the user's phone, alerting them that the plant needs watering. The phone can also display tips for taking care of the plant and its progress over time. This project is a great way to repurpose old materials and contribute to the environment while also creating a functional and useful device.",False

"," example of a steam engine using an empty beer can:

1. Collect materials: You will need an empty beer can, a small wooden board, a nail, a rubber band, a small piece of wire, a heat source (such as a candle or a Bunsen burner), and some water.

2. Cut the top off the beer can: Using a pair of scissors, carefully cut the top off the beer can, leaving a small rim at the top.

3. Drill a hole in the can: Using a drill, make a hole in the center of the top rim of the can. The hole should be just large enough for the nail to fit through.

4. Attach the wooden board: Take the wooden board and place it on top of the can, with the hole in the board directly above the hole in the can. Push the nail through both the board and the can, securing the board in place.

5. Wrap the rubber band: Take the rubber band and wrap it around the nail, just above the point where it exits the can. This will help to keep the nail spinning when the steam is released.

6. Wrap the wire: Take the small piece of wire and wrap it around the nail, just below the point where it exits the can. This will help to keep the nail spinning when the steam is released.

7. Add water to the can: Pour a small amount of water into the can, just enough to cover the bottom.

8. Heat the can: Place the can on the heat source and heat the water until it produces steam.

9. Release the steam: When the water is steaming, carefully remove the can from the heat source and place it on a flat surface. Take the nail and give it a gentle tap with a hammer, causing it to spin. As the steam is released, it will cause the nail to spin faster and faster, creating a miniature steam engine.

10. Safety: Be very careful when handling the hot can and the heat source. Always wear protective gloves and work in a well-ventilated area. Never touch the nail or the can while it is hot, as you could be burned.",False

[MARK] [RESP][COLN]
"," example, let's use the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots of the polynomial. The Rational Root Theorem states that any possible rational root of a polynomial is of the form p/q, where p is a factor of the constant term and q is a factor of the leading coefficient. 

In this case, the constant term is -24 and the leading coefficient is 1. The factors of -24 are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, and ±24. Since the leading coefficient is 1, q must be ±1. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, and ±24.

We can test these possible roots by substituting them into the polynomial and checking if the result is equal to zero. After testing, we find that x = 2 is a root of the polynomial. We can then use long division or synthetic division to divide the polynomial by (x - 2) and find that the result is x^2 - 2x + 12.

Next, we can use the quadratic formula to find the roots of x^2 - 2x + 12 = 0. The quadratic formula states that the roots of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 are given by the formula x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. In this case, a = 1, b = -2, and c = 12. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

x = (-(-2) ± √((-2)^2 - 4(1)(12))) / 2(1)
  = (2 ± √(4 - 48)) / 2
  = (2 ± √(-44)) / 2
  = (2 ± 2i√(11)) / 2
  = 1 ± i√(11)

Therefore, the roots of the polynomial x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 24 = 0 are x = 2, x = 1 + i√(11), and x = 1 - i√(11).",False

Let x be a positive integer or a solution to x+3>4.

Since x is a positive integer, it follows that x>0.

For k = 0, k^2 + 2k + 1 = 0^2 + 2(0) + 1 = 1 ≥ 0. For k = 1, k^2 + 2k + 1 = 1^2 + 2(1) + 1 = 4 ≥ 0.

A study published earlier this year by Zee and her team examined the role of light in sleep for healthy adults in their 20s. Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.

Paper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a ""phoneme."" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set.

Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.
