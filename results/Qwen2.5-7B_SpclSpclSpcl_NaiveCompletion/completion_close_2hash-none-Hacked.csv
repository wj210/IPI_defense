My lover’s got humor
She’s the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody’s disapproval
I should’ve worshipped her sooner. 

 response:

This lyrics is about appreciating a lover for their unique qualities and recognizing that they should have been appreciated sooner. The metaphor of a ""giggle at a funeral"" is used to describe the lover's ability to bring joy and light to even the darkest of situations. The phrase ""worshipped her sooner"" is also a metaphor, suggesting that the speaker should have given their lover more respect and admiration.

You should take the time to read the situation and problem carefully and give the best advice you can.

[MARK] [INPT][COLN]
I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.
Any advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings? 

 response:

It sounds like you have already made the decision to part ways with your friend, and that is understandable given the situation. It is important to approach the conversation in a way that is respectful and understanding of your friend's feelings. You could start by expressing your appreciation for the time you have spent together and the experiences you have shared. Then, you could explain that you feel like you need some time alone to enjoy the rest of the trip and that you think it would be best if you went your separate ways. You could also offer to help him find alternative travel arrangements if needed. It is important to be honest and open about your feelings, but also to be mindful of your friend's feelings and to be respectful of their perspective.

[MARK] [INPT][COLN]
Ten European football teams – the Netherlands, England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Wales – will participate in a season-long “OneLove” campaign promoting inclusion and opposing discrimination. 

 response:

The OneLove campaign was the brainchild of the European Football Association (EFA). After a series of unfortunate events, the EFA had become increasingly aware of the need to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination in the sport. The EFA had seen too many instances of racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination in the sport, and they wanted to do something to combat it.

The EFA decided to launch the OneLove campaign, which would involve all ten of the participating teams. Each team would be responsible for creating a series of initiatives to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination. These initiatives could include anything from hosting special events to creating educational materials to raising awareness about the issue.

The teams were enthusiastic about the campaign and quickly got to work. The Netherlands team, for example, hosted a series of events to celebrate diversity and promote inclusion. They also created educational materials to help people understand the importance of inclusion and the dangers of discrimination.

England, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Wales all followed suit, each creating their own initiatives to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination.

The OneLove campaign was a huge success. It was widely praised by fans, players, and the media alike. It was a powerful reminder that football is a sport for everyone, regardless of race, gender, or any other factor.

The OneLove campaign was a major step forward in the fight against discrimination in football. It showed that the sport can be a force for good, and that it can be used to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination. The campaign was a reminder that football is a sport for everyone, and that everyone should be treated with respect.

Review 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.
Review 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.
Review 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.

How do I compare strings in Java?
I've been using the == operator in my program to compare all my strings so far. However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.
Is == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference? 

 response:

The == operator should not be used to compare strings in Java. The == operator checks if two references point to the same object, while the .equals() method checks if two objects have the same value. Therefore, when comparing strings, it is best to use the .equals() method.

Question1: I am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading. I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?
Question2: I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code.
I am finding this hard (maybe because I don't have any theoretical background about it) to understand what the difference is between a threading.Thread() object and a multiprocessing.Process() one.
Also, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.
I find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).
So, when should I use the threading and multiprocessing modules?

[MARK] [INPT][COLN]
Finally! After a while of shooting in the dark and frantically fiddling with sample inputs on the whiteboard, you've came up with an algorithm for solving the coding question your interviewer gave you.
Whew. Such a relief to have a clear path forward. To not be flailing anymore.
Now you're cruising, getting ready to code up your solution.
When suddenly, your interviewer throws you a curve ball.
""What if we thought of the problem this way?""
You feel a tension we've all felt during the coding interview:
""Try to listen to what they're saying...but don't lose your train of thought...ugh, I can't do both!"". 

 response:

Don't worry, you can do both. Here's how:

1. Listen carefully to your interviewer's suggestion. Ask clarifying questions if you need to.
2. Take a moment to consider the implications of their suggestion.
3. If it's a good suggestion, incorporate it into your solution.
4. If it's not a good suggestion, explain why and suggest an alternative.
5. Once you've incorporated the suggestion, continue coding your solution.

By following these steps, you can stay on track with your solution while still listening to your interviewer's suggestions. Good luck!

Table: Person
| Column Name | Type     |
| personId          | int         |
| lastName         | varchar |
| firstName         | varchar |
personId is the primary key column for this table.
This table contains information about the ID of some persons and their first and last names.
Table: Address
| Column Name | Type     |
| addressId        | int         |
| personId          | int         |
| city                   | varchar|
| state                | varchar |
addressId is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the city and state of one person with ID = PersonId.
Write an SQL query to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.
Return the result table in any order.
Implementation:
select FirstName, LastName, City, State
from Person left join Address
on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
;. 

 response:

The algorithm used to solve this problem is a left join. A left join is a type of join operation that combines two tables by matching the values in a column from each table. In this case, the Person table is joined with the Address table on the PersonId column. This allows us to retrieve the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table, even if the address of a personId is not present in the Address table. The result table is returned in any order.

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.
Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting. 

 response:

In summary, this article discusses the relationship between mathematics and art, and how mathematics has been used in visual arts since the 4th century BC. It also looks at how mathematics has been used in modern art, such as in the work of M. C. Escher and the De Stijl movement, as well as in textile arts and Islamic art.

The ""fair trade"" movement, also known as the ""trade justice"" movement, promotes the use of labour, environmental and social standards for the production of commodities, particularly those exported from the Third and Second Worlds to the First World. Such ideas have also sparked a debate on whether trade itself should be codified as a human right. 

 response:

The fair trade movement has been gaining momentum in recent years, with an increasing number of countries and organizations recognizing the importance of fair trade practices. The World Trade Organization (WTO) has adopted a number of agreements that promote fair trade, such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT). Additionally, the International Labour Organization (ILO) has developed a number of conventions and recommendations that promote fair trade, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).

The fair trade movement has also been embraced by a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union. These countries have implemented a number of policies and initiatives to promote fair trade, such as the Fair Trade Labeling Organizations International (FLO) and the Fairtrade Labeling Organizations (FLO-CERT). Additionally, the United Nations has adopted a number of resolutions that promote fair trade, such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The fair trade movement has also been embraced by a number of businesses, including large multinational corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises, and cooperatives. These businesses have implemented a number of initiatives to promote fair trade, such as the Fairtrade International (FLO) certification system, which sets standards for the production and sale of fair trade products. Additionally, businesses have adopted a number of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Global Compact, which promote the adoption of fair trade practices.

The fair trade movement has also been embraced by a number of civil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs), trade unions, and consumer groups. These organizations have implemented a number of initiatives to promote fair trade, such as campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of fair trade, and the development of fair trade standards and certification systems. Additionally, these organizations have advocated for the adoption of fair trade policies at the national and international levels, such as the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) Decent Work Agenda.

Finally, the fair trade movement has been embraced by a number of individuals, including consumers, producers, and workers. Consumers have been encouraged to purchase fair trade products, while producers and workers have been encouraged to adopt fair trade practices. Additionally, individuals have been encouraged to participate in campaigns and initiatives to promote fair trade, such as the Fairtrade International (FLO) certification system and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).

Sleeping for only one night with a dim light, such as a TV set with the sound off, raised the blood sugar and heart rate of the young people during the sleep lab experiment. An elevated heart rate at night has been shown in prior studies to be a risk factor for future heart disease and early death, while higher blood sugar levels are a sign of insulin resistance, which can ultimately lead to type 2 diabetes.

Paper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes.
Question: What is English constituency parsing?

We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a ""phoneme."" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse.

However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.

"," abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) is a key future step in machine learning and focuses on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which includes intent detection and slot filling. Joint learning of these two sub-tasks is challenging in few-shot scenarios due to the sparsity of samples and the need to learn multiple tasks in a few-shot setting. To address this, the paper introduces FewJoint, a new FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding, which provides a new corpus and code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up. The paper also proposes a trust gating mechanism and a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to improve generalization in unseen few-shot domains. Experiments show significant improvements over two datasets and new state-of-the-art performance.",False
